       "      <td>a great scientist dies when i got to the lecture hall , there was a crowd outside but no one was allowed in . there had been threats of violence and the talk was canceled . most of my friends were happy : the “ racist ” had been defeated . although i was convinced jensen was completely wrong , it seemed cowardly and shameful to silence a man , no matter what his views . it didn ’ t occur to me that i was acting shamefully . i knew nothing about genetics or iq testing—nothing at all—and yet i was convinced i knew better than a scientist who had studied the subject thoroughly . how embarrassing to have been such an arrogant young lefty ! the goons who shut down jensen ’ s talk may have had an influence on my life . it took me 15 years to realize that jensen was right , and that i and the goons were wrong . surely , my eyes would have been opened sooner if jensen had been able to speak , and i had heard the calm , factual , talk he would surely have given . the primacy of datauntil 1967 , when he was 43 years old , arthur jensen believed that differences in iq were almost entirely determined by environment . he had received a phd in psychology from columbia in 1950 , had worked with hans eysenck in london from 1956 to 1958 and also in 1964 , and had become a full professor at uc berkeley in 1966 . he had studied retarded children with iqs lower than 75 and had found racial differences in patterns of mental disability . still , he held conventional views . in 1967 , jensen received a guggenheim fellowship to study at the center for the advanced study in the behavioral sciences in palo alto , california , where he planned to do research for a book about how cultural deprivation depresses the intelligence of minorities . at the center he met a geneticist who persuaded him to study the genetics of intelligence , and this completely changed his views . instead of writing a book , he wrote his famous february 1969 article for the harvard educational review , “ how much can we boost iq and scholastic achievement ? ” in this 123-page article , he laid the foundation for a correct understanding of intelligence : iq tests are valid and reliable , they are not biased against minorities , social mobility means that the genes for high iq are concentrated in higher social strata , and there is a substantial genetic contribution to both individual and group differences in intelligence . there was an immediate explosion ( the best account is roger pearson , race , intelligence and bias in academe , scott-townsend publishers , 1991 ) . the board of harvard educational review came under so much pressure it stopped making reprints of the article—not even jensen could get any . it explained this was because the article “ presents a view of intelligence that we feel must be read in the context of expert discussion from other psychologists and geneticists . ” in many libraries , vandals tore the article out of the magazine and destroyed it . leftists on campus called for jensen to be fired—and worse . in july of the same year , martin deutsch ( 1926-2002 ) , who was involved in setting up head start , made a speech at michigan state university in which he claimed that jensen ’ s article contained “ 53 major errors or misinterpretations . ” this claim was gobbled up by the left despite deutsch ’ s refusal to say what the errors were . in 1973 , he admitted that the “ 53 errors ” was an off-the-cuff answer to a question from the audience , and that he had no idea the claim would be trumpeted by egalitarians . yale was not the only place where jensen was silenced , and police protected him several times from howling mobs that rushed the podium . as psychologist sandra scarr has written , “ i learned what it is like to be spat upon and to put my body on the line to get art out of a university of minnesota auditorium . it was shocking and frightening , as surely the radicals intended . . . . ” at home in berkeley , jensen received so many vicious telephone calls—many late at night—that for a time his family routed all calls through the police station . the police advised him to move out of his house , and he stayed with friends . there were threats against the jensens ’ 11-year-old daughter , and for almost a year the police warned her not to walk the two blocks to the school bus . for several years , jensen filed his movements in advance with the campus police . if he needed to go somewhere , two officers showed up to accompany him . one year , two plain-clothes men attended his class to keep an eye out for thugs . jensen was always cheerful in the face of hatred , but he was bothered by its effect on others : jensen ’ s persecution continued for years . in 1977 he went on what was to be a lecture tour of eight australian universities , along with hans eysenck of the university of london institute of psychiatry . the men were not even going to speak about race—only about iq , personality , and learning—but the left found this intolerable . at his first stop , the university of melbourne , demonstrators tried to keep people out of the lecture hall . when jensen began to speak , they banged on metal bins and chanted : “ what do we want ? jensen ! how do we want him ? dead ! ” jensen could not be heard over the din , and escaped to a basement room , where he continued his talk through a video link to the lecture hall . the lefties then broke into the basement room and ended the talk . after this debacle , three of the other universities canceled jensen ’ s talks outright , and several others allowed attendance by invitation only . only at the university of adelaide was he able to give a public lecture to a packed house . throughout this period , jensen continued to write journal articles and books . he published genetics and education in 1972 and educability and group differences in 1973 . his massive , 800-page bias in mental testing , published in 1980 , demolished the then-fashionable view that iq tests were biased against women , minorities , and poor people . it was so successful among scholars that his publishers urged him to write a popular version , straight talk about mental tests , which appeared in 1981 . i meet arthur jensenby the time of my first meeting with jensen in 1992 , he was a giant in his field , with more publications and citations than virtually anyone else in psychology . he graciously agreed to give me an interview , which went on for several hours and ranged widely over forbidden subjects . jensen told me that by then the hostility had waned and that he was living a normal life . he assured me that his students were surprised at nothing he taught them ; that they could not understand what all the shouting had been about in the old days . when we were not recording , we talked of many things , and i discovered that jensen was like all genuinely accomplished men i have met : he had striking insights on subjects in many fields , not just his own . also , he was not angry at his attackers ; just baffled . why couldn ’ t they just look at the data ? there is no doubt that jensen , with help from such people as hans eysenck , philippe rushton , richard lynn , linda gottfredson , helmuth nyborg , and michael levin , eventually convinced the experts that genes account for 50 to 80 percent of variation in individual iq and contribute substantially to group variation—but they never managed to convince the media . by the mid 1990s , jensen was hard at work on what was to be his crowning achievement , the g factor , but could not find a publisher . a deep chill had fallen over the book industry , and methuen , jensen ’ s usual publisher , and the free press , which had published straight talk about mental testing , would not touch the g factor . jensen had to settle for praeger publilshers , which had a reputation for accepting controversial titles but printing very few copies and selling them at very high prices . at 648 pages , the g factor was an extraordinary work of science , and praeger priced it at a relatively affordable $ 39 . 95 . it was a magisterial investigation of the nature of intelligence , the extent to which it is under genetic control , and its uneven distribution between individuals and groups . after i reviewed it , i was greatly flattered when jensen told me it was the best summary of the book anyone had written , and that he was making copies to send to associates and friends . however , he said the review contained an important error : i had written that when blacks and whites are matched for brain size they have the same iq , but that was a mistake . he explained that when blacks and whites are matched for iq they have the same brain size , but the relationship does not run the other way . there are other aspects of the brain besides size—neurofunction , brain metabolism , etc . —that influence intelligence , and the races appear to differ in these as well . therefore , for blacks to match whites in iq , equivalent brain size is a necessary but not a sufficient condition . i had always heard that jensen prized accuracy . jensen won admiration for his research and analysis , but he was loved for his character . always the gentleman , always the scientist , he never ran from controversy but he never sought it . in 2003 , in cooperation with phillipe rushton and linda gottfredson , jensen ’ s danish colleague helmuth nyborg published the scientific study of general intelligence : tribute to arthur r. jensen . this was a 642-page collection of articles that were both tributes to a great scientist and major contributions to the field . many authors noted that jensen ’ s true love was data . as professor nyborg wrote , “ if art is loyal to data he is entirely unfaithful to theory , ” noting that jensen would readily sacrifice his own theories if the data did not support them . “ give art a proper analysis and good data , ” he wrote , “ and his mind will follow , entirely independently of his previous views , ” adding , “ that is far more than one can say for most of his critics ! ” thomas j. bouchard , who directed the minnesota twin study , has said jensen ’ s scientific work is “ intensive , detailed , exhaustive , fair-minded , temperate , and courageous . ” like all who knew him , prof. bouchard was deeply impressed by jensen ’ s self possession : “ for someone who has been attacked so vituperatively , both in public and in the published literature , i continue to be astounded at the lack of anger and hostility in his replies and the astuteness with which he dissects the arguments of his critics . ” jensen ’ s former students added to the nyborg collection with comments such as : “ the finest examples of college teaching i have ever experienced , ” “ i can not imagine a better mentor , ” “ he showed astonishing patience with his critics , ” “ the toughest reviewer around , ” “ his own thirst for knowledge is infectious . ” in 2005 , together with philippe rushton , jensen published what i think is the best short , academic summary of iq research ever written : “ thirty years of research on race differences in cognitive ability . ” by then , however , jensen was suffering from parkinson ’ s disease . he continued to publish , but his output declined . arthur jensen died on october 22 . his family kept the event quiet , but the news has now leaked out . when a man of his stature dies , even an enemy establishment is compelled to take notice , and it will be edifying to read the flummery that is sure to appear . the major papers will certainly not admit it , but arthur jensen was a great scientist and a man of great dignity , even nobility . in a sane world , he would have been a serious contender for a nobel prize . that his death should follow so soon upon that of his eminent colleague and friend , philippe rushton , only compounds the terrible loss that science—and mankind—have suffered . topics : race and intelligence , racial differences , science and genetics</td>\n",

       "      <td>a great scientist dies when i got to the lecture hall , there was a crowd outside but no one was allowed in . there had been threats of violence and the talk was canceled . most of my friends were happy : the “ racist ” had been defeated . although i was convinced jensen was completely wrong , it seemed cowardly and shameful to silence a man , no matter what his views . it didn ’ t occur to me that i was acting shamefully . i knew nothing about genetics or iq testing—nothing at all—and yet i was convinced i knew better than a scientist who had studied the subject thoroughly . how embarrassing to have been such an arrogant young lefty ! the goons who shut down jensen ’ s talk may have had an influence on my life . it took me 15 years to realize that jensen was right , and that i and the goons were wrong . surely , my eyes would have been opened sooner if jensen had been able to speak , and i had heard the calm , factual , talk he would surely have given . the primacy of datauntil 1967 , when he was 43 years old , arthur jensen believed that differences in iq were almost entirely determined by environment . he had received a phd in psychology from columbia in 1950 , had worked with hans eysenck in london from 1956 to 1958 and also in 1964 , and had become a full professor at uc berkeley in 1966 . he had studied retarded children with iqs lower than 75 and had found racial differences in patterns of mental disability . still , he held conventional views . in 1967 , jensen received a guggenheim fellowship to study at the center for the advanced study in the behavioral sciences in palo alto , california , where he planned to do research for a book about how cultural deprivation depresses the intelligence of minorities . at the center he met a geneticist who persuaded him to study the genetics of intelligence , and this completely changed his views . instead of writing a book , he wrote his famous february 1969 article for the harvard educational review , “ how much can we boost iq and scholastic achievement ? ” in this 123-page article , he laid the foundation for a correct understanding of intelligence : iq tests are valid and reliable , they are not biased against minorities , social mobility means that the genes for high iq are concentrated in higher social strata , and there is a substantial genetic contribution to both individual and group differences in intelligence . there was an immediate explosion ( the best account is roger pearson , race , intelligence and bias in academe , scott-townsend publishers , 1991 ) . the board of harvard educational review came under so much pressure it stopped making reprints of the article—not even jensen could get any . it explained this was because the article “ presents a view of intelligence that we feel must be read in the context of expert discussion from other psychologists and geneticists . ” in many libraries , vandals tore the article out of the magazine and destroyed it . leftists on campus called for jensen to be fired—and worse . in july of the same year , martin deutsch ( 1926-2002 ) , who was involved in setting up head start , made a speech at michigan state university in which he claimed that jensen ’ s article contained “ 53 major errors or misinterpretations . ” this claim was gobbled up by the left despite deutsch ’ s refusal to say what the errors were . in 1973 , he admitted that the “ 53 errors ” was an off-the-cuff answer to a question from the audience , and that he had no idea the claim would be trumpeted by egalitarians . yale was not the only place where jensen was silenced , and police protected him several times from howling mobs that rushed the podium . as psychologist sandra scarr has written , “ i learned what it is like to be spat upon and to put my body on the line to get art out of a university of minnesota auditorium . it was shocking and frightening , as surely the radicals intended . . . . ” at home in berkeley , jensen received so many vicious telephone calls—many late at night—that for a time his family routed all calls through the police station . the police advised him to move out of his house , and he stayed with friends . there were threats against the jensens ’ 11-year-old daughter , and for almost a year the police warned her not to walk the two blocks to the school bus . for several years , jensen filed his movements in advance with the campus police . if he needed to go somewhere , two officers showed up to accompany him . one year , two plain-clothes men attended his class to keep an eye out for thugs . jensen was always cheerful in the face of hatred , but he was bothered by its effect on others : jensen ’ s persecution continued for years . in 1977 he went on what was to be a lecture tour of eight australian universities , along with hans eysenck of the university of london institute of psychiatry . the men were not even going to speak about race—only about iq , personality , and learning—but the left found this intolerable . at his first stop , the university of melbourne , demonstrators tried to keep people out of the lecture hall . when jensen began to speak , they banged on metal bins and chanted : “ what do we want ? jensen ! how do we want him ? dead ! ” jensen could not be heard over the din , and escaped to a basement room , where he continued his talk through a video link to the lecture hall . the lefties then broke into the basement room and ended the talk . after this debacle , three of the other universities canceled jensen ’ s talks outright , and several others allowed attendance by invitation only . only at the university of adelaide was he able to give a public lecture to a packed house . throughout this period , jensen continued to write journal articles and books . he published genetics and education in 1972 and educability and group differences in 1973 . his massive , 800-page bias in mental testing , published in 1980 , demolished the then-fashionable view that iq tests were biased against women , minorities , and poor people . it was so successful among scholars that his publishers urged him to write a popular version , straight talk about mental tests , which appeared in 1981 . i meet arthur jensenby the time of my first meeting with jensen in 1992 , he was a giant in his field , with more publications and citations than virtually anyone else in psychology . he graciously agreed to give me an interview , which went on for several hours and ranged widely over forbidden subjects . jensen told me that by then the hostility had waned and that he was living a normal life . he assured me that his students were surprised at nothing he taught them ; that they could not understand what all the shouting had been about in the old days . when we were not recording , we talked of many things , and i discovered that jensen was like all genuinely accomplished men i have met : he had striking insights on subjects in many fields , not just his own . also , he was not angry at his attackers ; just baffled . why couldn ’ t they just look at the data ? there is no doubt that jensen , with help from such people as hans eysenck , philippe rushton , richard lynn , linda gottfredson , helmuth nyborg , and michael levin , eventually convinced the experts that genes account for 50 to 80 percent of variation in individual iq and contribute substantially to group variation—but they never managed to convince the media . by the mid 1990s , jensen was hard at work on what was to be his crowning achievement , the g factor , but could not find a publisher . a deep chill had fallen over the book industry , and methuen , jensen ’ s usual publisher , and the free press , which had published straight talk about mental testing , would not touch the g factor . jensen had to settle for praeger publilshers , which had a reputation for accepting controversial titles but printing very few copies and selling them at very high prices . at 648 pages , the g factor was an extraordinary work of science , and praeger priced it at a relatively affordable $ 39 . 95 . it was a magisterial investigation of the nature of intelligence , the extent to which it is under genetic control , and its uneven distribution between individuals and groups . after i reviewed it , i was greatly flattered when jensen told me it was the best summary of the book anyone had written , and that he was making copies to send to associates and friends . however , he said the review contained an important error : i had written that when blacks and whites are matched for brain size they have the same iq , but that was a mistake . he explained that when blacks and whites are matched for iq they have the same brain size , but the relationship does not run the other way . there are other aspects of the brain besides size—neurofunction , brain metabolism , etc . —that influence intelligence , and the races appear to differ in these as well . therefore , for blacks to match whites in iq , equivalent brain size is a necessary but not a sufficient condition . i had always heard that jensen prized accuracy . jensen won admiration for his research and analysis , but he was loved for his character . always the gentleman , always the scientist , he never ran from controversy but he never sought it . in 2003 , in cooperation with phillipe rushton and linda gottfredson , jensen ’ s danish colleague helmuth nyborg published the scientific study of general intelligence : tribute to arthur r. jensen . this was a 642-page collection of articles that were both tributes to a great scientist and major contributions to the field . many authors noted that jensen ’ s true love was data . as professor nyborg wrote , “ if art is loyal to data he is entirely unfaithful to theory , ” noting that jensen would readily sacrifice his own theories if the data did not support them . “ give art a proper analysis and good data , ” he wrote , “ and his mind will follow , entirely independently of his previous views , ” adding , “ that is far more than one can say for most of his critics ! ” thomas j. bouchard , who directed the minnesota twin study , has said jensen ’ s scientific work is “ intensive , detailed , exhaustive , fair-minded , temperate , and courageous . ” like all who knew him , prof. bouchard was deeply impressed by jensen ’ s self possession : “ for someone who has been attacked so vituperatively , both in public and in the published literature , i continue to be astounded at the lack of anger and hostility in his replies and the astuteness with which he dissects the arguments of his critics . ” jensen ’ s former students added to the nyborg collection with comments such as : “ the finest examples of college teaching i have ever experienced , ” “ i can not imagine a better mentor , ” “ he showed astonishing patience with his critics , ” “ the toughest reviewer around , ” “ his own thirst for knowledge is infectious . ” in 2005 , together with philippe rushton , jensen published what i think is the best short , academic summary of iq research ever written : “ thirty years of research on race differences in cognitive ability . ” by then , however , jensen was suffering from parkinson ’ s disease . he continued to publish , but his output declined . arthur jensen died on october 22 . his family kept the event quiet , but the news has now leaked out . when a man of his stature dies , even an enemy establishment is compelled to take notice , and it will be edifying to read the flummery that is sure to appear . the major papers will certainly not admit it , but arthur jensen was a great scientist and a man of great dignity , even nobility . in a sane world , he would have been a serious contender for a nobel prize . that his death should follow so soon upon that of his eminent colleague and friend , philippe rushton , only compounds the terrible loss that science—and mankind—have suffered . topics : race and intelligence , racial differences , science and genetics</td>\n",

       "      <td>a maniac is running our foreign policy ! ( it ’ s not trump ) judge robart ’ s veto of trump ’ s travel ban notwithstanding , there is not the slightest question but that the president , in his sole discretion , can choose to admit or exclude any foreigners he likes , based on “ the interests of the united states . ” the clinton administration used the executive branch ’ s broad power over immigration to send a 6-year-old boy back to a communist dictatorship . the courts were completely powerless to stop him . as explained by the federal appellate court that ruled on elian gonzalez ’ s asylum application : “ it is the duty of the congress and of the executive branch to exercise political will , ” and “ in no context is the executive branch entitled to more deference than in the context of foreign affairs , ” which includes immigration . the court acknowledged that elian might well be subjected to “ re-education , ” “ communist indoctrination ” and “ political manipulation . ” ( then again , so would enrolling him at sidwell friends . ) it didn ’ t matter ! sending little boys back to communist dictatorships was the policy of the clinton administration . the obama administration ’ s immigration policy was to ensure that millions of poverty-stricken foreigners would come here and help turn our country into a mexican version of pakistan . when arizona merely tried to enforce the federal immigration laws being ignored by the obama administration , the entire media erupted in rage at this incursion into the majestic power of the president over immigration . they said it was like living in nazi germany ! the most reviled section of the act , melodramatically called the “ papers please ” law , was upheld by the supreme court . but the other parts , allowing state officials to enforce federal immigration laws , were ruled unconstitutional . a president ’ s policy choice to ignore immigration laws supersedes a state ’ s right to enforce them . the court conceded that hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens were arrested in arizona each year , that they were responsible for “ a disproportionate share of serious crime , ” and that illegals constituted nearly 6 percent of arizona ’ s population . but arizona was powerless to enforce laws on the books — if those laws happened to be about immigration . the president ’ s authority over immigration is absolute and exclusive , as part of his authority over foreign policy . to review : — when the president ’ s immigration policy is to promote international communism : the president wins . — when the president ’ s immigration policy is to transform america into a different country : the president wins . — but when the president ’ s immigration policy is to protect americans : some piss-ant judge announces that his authority exceeds that of the president . this is exactly what i warned you about in adios , america : the left ’ s plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole . nothing trump does will be met with such massive resistance as his immigration policies . the left used to attack america by spying for stalin , aiding our enemies , murdering cops and blowing up buildings . but , then liberals realized , it ’ s so much more effective to just do away with america altogether ! teddy kennedy gave them their chance with the 1965 immigration act . since then , we ’ ve been taking in more than a million immigrants a year , 90 percent from comically primitive cultures . they like the welfare , but have very little interest in adopting the rest of our culture . in many parts of the country , you ’ re already not living in america . just a few more years , and the transformation will be complete . there will be a north american landmass known as “ the united states , ” but it won ’ t be our country . the only thing that stands between america and oblivion is a total immigration moratorium . we are well past the point of quick fixes — as judge robart ’ s delusional ruling proves . the judiciary , both political parties , the media , hollywood , corporate america and approximately 1 million lobbying groups are all working frantically to bring the hardest cases to our shores . left-wing traitors , who used to honeymoon in cuba and fight with peasant revolutionaries in peru , toil away , late into the night , to ensure that genocidal rwandans can move to america and immediately start collecting food stamps , medicaid and social security . no matter how clearly laws are written , government bureaucrats connive to import people from countries that a majority of americans would not want to visit , much less become . federal judges issue lunatic rulings to ensure that there will never be a pause in the transformation of america . congress could write laws requiring immigrants to pay taxes , learn english , forgo welfare and have good moral character . it could write laws giving the president authority to exclude aliens in the public interest . except it already has . those laws were swept away by ins officials , federal judges and democratic administrations — under ferocious pressure from america-hating , left-wing groups . the country will not be safe until the following outfits are out of business : the aclu ’ s immigrants ’ rights project ; the national immigration forum ; the national immigration law center ; the national immigration project of the national lawyers guild ; the national network for immigrant and refugee rights ; the office of migration and refugee services ; the american immigration law foundation ; the american immigration lawyers association ; the border information and outreach service ; atlas : diy ; the catholic legal immigration network ; the clearinghouse for immigrant education ; the farmworker justice fund ; grantmakers concerned with immigrants and refugees ; the immigrant legal resource center ; the international center for migration , ethnicity and citizenship ; the lesbian and gay immigration rights task force ; the lutheran immigration and refugee service ; the national association for bilingual education ; the national clearinghouse on agricultural guest worker issues ; the national coalition for dignity and amnesty for undocumented immigrants ; the national coalition for haitian rights ; the national council of la raza ; and the national farm worker ministry . and that ’ s only a small fraction of the anti-american immigration groups assiduously dragging the third world to our shores — while you were busy working . look at that list — look at judge robart ’ s ruling ! — and ask yourself : is it possible that anything short of a total immigration moratorium can save this country ? only when there is no immigration to bellyache about will these nuts be forced to think of a new way to destroy america . topics : donald trump , immigration , immigration law , immigration law enforcement</td>\n",

       "      <td>“ conservatives ” blast trump their writers then get to work . mr. trump is a “ con man ” ( mona charen ) , a “ know-nothing demagogue ” who suffers from “ raging egomania ” ( mark helprin ) , “ the politicized american id ” ( john podhoretz ) , a “ glib egomaniac ” and “ bombastic showoff ” ( thomas sowell ) , a “ political conman ” ( katie pavlich ) , a “ narcissist ” ( cal thomas ) , a harbinger of “ two-bit caesarism ” ( william kristol ) , a peddler of “ know-nothing protectionism , ” “ nativism , ” and “ one-man rule ” ( david boaz ) , etc . you know you ’ ve won the argument when your opponents are reduced to name-calling . but there are a few substantive complaints amidst the roaring . one is that mr. trump is too ignorant to run the country . according to mark helprin , mr. trump “ doesn ’ t know the constitution , history , law , political philosophy , nuclear strategy , diplomacy , defense , economics beyond real estate , ” and so on . this is true of almost the entire political class . ronald reagan and george w. bush were genial ignoramuses , but reagan is a hero to national review . andrew mccarthy sniffs that mr. trump doesn ’ t know who hassan nasrallah is . i doubt mike huckabee , jim gilmore , chris christie or john kasich know who he is either , and ben carson thinks the pyramids were built to store grain . several nr writers think mr. trump wants to be a dictator . david boaz of cato says that mr. trump “ is effectively vowing to be an american mussolini . . . and govern by fiat . ” mr. trump is certainly full of promises about what he will do , but so is every other candidate . they say “ i will ( fill in the blank ) . ” they don ’ t say “ i will persuade congress to pass legislation that will ( fill in the blank ) . ” many of these “ conservatives ” say they worship limited government and the separation of powers , and perhaps they do , but i can ’ t think of a recent president who hasn ’ t attacked another country without a declaration of war , and barack obama has run wild with executive orders . the nr “ conservatives ” may not like that , but why are they angrier about what mr. trump hasn ’ t done than what others have done ? according to their precious constitution , the supreme court and the threat of impeachment will curb mr. trump ’ s imagined excesses . but donald trump is guilty of worse than ceasarism and bombast . national review considers itself the tabernacle of conservatism , and its high priests have declared that mr. trump is not a conservative . they say he ’ s a closet liberal on abortion , gun control , socialized medicine , and big government . for me and for millions of americans , the answer to that is a resounding “ who cares ? ” most of the time , donald trump doesn ’ t even claim to be a conservative . he cares deeply about the well-being and happiness of americans , and is the first major candidate since patrick buchanan who understands that south-of-the-border illiterates don ’ t make good americans . so long as he sticks to that message it won ’ t make any difference whether he ’ s “ liberal ” or “ conservative ” or a conman or a showoff or any of the other names national review calls him . people of all political persuasions will vote for him . there is nothing partisan about wanting your people to survive and prosper . what does the saying “ politics stops at the water ’ s edge ” mean but that when the survival of the nation is threatened we set aside disagreements and fight the common enemy . our survival is threatened , and mr. trump is the only candidate who seems to understand that . but nr ’ s sniffing about mr. trump not being a conservative highlights the most inexplicable and pathetic thing about “ conservatives . ” they don ’ t realize that the one thing that must absolutely be conserved is something they pride themselves on pretending doesn ’ t matter : the race of people who make what they call conservatism even possible . do they really believe that mexicans and haitians and guatemalans and vietnamese and bangladeshis and chinese are ever going to be made to care about the second amendment or madisonian democracy or limited government ? this is why these people are cuckolded conservatives or “ cuckservatives . ” just like a man with a faithless wife , they are lavishing care on somebody else ’ s children . their beautiful constitution and elegant libertarianism are wasted on third-worlders , for whom these things are alien and meaningless . the institutions national review thinks it is preserving will be kicked aside by people whose ancestors had no hand in building them . what cuckservatives are determined not to understand is that without the historic american people , there is no america , no western culture , no civilization fit for white men . anyone who stands for the european people and traditions of america is our comrade , whatever his politics . there is something grotesque about people who sacrifice americans to abstractions , who put principle over people . and if they think that pronouncing donald trump “ not a conservative ” will move the electoral balance by even a hair they are deluded . do they imagine people all across america saying to themselves , “ i was going to vote for trump , but nr says he ’ s not a conservative so i guess i ’ ll vote for jeb bush ” ? liberals are just as deluded about the insignificance of race , of course . their vision of the perfect society requires a population of danes , not mexicans . the only part of “ liberalism ” third-worlders understand is government handouts . feminism , gay rights , “ diversity , ” “ tolerance , ” environmentalism , yoga and fruit-juice drinking–you don ’ t see much of that in “ communities of color . ” but liberals are at least consistent in their madness . they want to change everything , so it is more excusable that they not realize that changing the population makes their kind of change impossible . but back to the anti-trump blasts , i almost forgot : not one of the nr 22 dared call mr. trump a “ racist ” on the record , but there were plenty of hints : “ trump ’ s vitriolic–and often racist and sexist language–language ” ( russell moore ) , “ the unavoidable issue of racism ” ( michael medved ) , and “ racial and religious scapegoating ” ( david boaz ) . keep it up , national review . you ’ re beginning to sound just like the washington post ; dana milbank titled one of his columns “ donald trump is a bigot and a racist . ” when both national review and the washington post agree that the republican front-runner and probable nominee–a man who could well become the president of the united states–is a “ racist , ” we know that a new day is dawning in america . topics : donald trump , elections , immigration</td>\n",

       "      <td>“ our values ” ? whose values ? in the barack obama universe , the carnage in boston , orlando , san bernardino , fort-hood and chattanooga dwarfs when compared to the importance of preserving “ our values . ” ( by which obama means his values , hillary clinton ’ s values , angela merkel ’ s values , sally yates ’ s values , chucky schumer ’ s values , jeff bezos ’ s values , john mcmussolini ’ s values , lindsey graham ’ s values . ) when a politician pules about “ the values that make our country great , ” to quote mrs. clinton , chances are they mean multiculturalism , pluralism , wide-swung borders , islam as peace , communities divided in diversity as a net positive , and the constitution—it mandates all the above , just ask ruth bader ginsburg—as a living , breathing , mutating philosophical malignancy . for them , “ protecting ” the abstraction that is “ our way of life ” trumps the protection of real individual lives . “ we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are , ” dissembled obama in the waning weeks before he was gone . the empty phrase is meant to make the sovereign citizen—you—forget that government ’ s most important role , if not its only role , is to protect individual life . this is something president trump grasps on a gut level . in his last few addresses , obama promised to speak up on “ certain issues , ” in times when he imagined “ our core values may be at stake . ” likewise , in delivering her control-alt-delete speech against the deplorables , clinton had asserted that “ our country is great because we ’ re good . … donald trump disregards the values that make our country great . ” the two ’ s group-think , notwithstanding , only individuals can be virtuous , not collectives . self-government , and not imposed government , implies that society , and not the state , is to develop value systems . the state ’ s role is to protect citizens as they go about their business peacefully , living in accordance with their peaceful values . when you hear an appeal to “ permanent values ” — ” the values that make our country great , ” to quote clinton—know you are dealing with world-class crooks . these crooks want to swindle you out of the freedom to think and believe as you wish . for in the classical conservative and libertarian traditions , values are private things , to be left to civil society—the individual , family and church—to practice and police . the american government is charged purely with upholding the law , no more . why so ? because government has police and military powers with which to enforce its “ values . ” a free people dare not entrust such an omnipotent entity with policing values , at home or abroad , because values enforced are dogma . when incontestable majorities call on government to curb islamic and other in-migration because this imperils american lives , president trump ’ s unswerving opponents—the obama , clinton , ryan , mccain , graham , schumer and media mafia—will invariably intone , “ that ’ s not who we are . ” when you hear that manipulative mantra , tell them to shut up , mind their own business , and stick to their constitutional mandate to protect the people , not police their minds . remember that through an appeal to values , the state aggrandizes itself . a limited government , serving an ostensibly free people , must thus never enforce values . because our form of government is incompatible with the enforcement of values , the american people can ’ t and mustn ’ t welcome into their midst civilizations whose values are inimical to the survival of their own . topics : donald trump , multiculturalism and diversity</td>\n",

       "calderon2021_23     a great scientist dies when i got to the lecture hall , there was a crowd outside but no one was allowed in . there had been threats of violence and the talk was canceled . most of my friends were happy : the “ racist ” had been defeated . although i was convinced jensen was completely wrong , it seemed cowardly and shameful to silence a man , no matter what his views . it didn ’ t occur to me that i was acting shamefully . i knew nothing about genetics or iq testing—nothing at all—and yet i was convinced i knew better than a scientist who had studied the subject thoroughly . how embarrassing to have been such an arrogant young lefty ! the goons who shut down jensen ’ s talk may have had an influence on my life . it took me 15 years to realize that jensen was right , and that i and the goons were wrong . surely , my eyes would have been opened sooner if jensen had been able to speak , and i had heard the calm , factual , talk he would surely have given . the primacy of datauntil 1967 , when he was 43 years old , arthur jensen believed that differences in iq were almost entirely determined by environment . he had received a phd in psychology from columbia in 1950 , had worked with hans eysenck in london from 1956 to 1958 and also in 1964 , and had become a full professor at uc berkeley in 1966 . he had studied retarded children with iqs lower than 75 and had found racial differences in patterns of mental disability . still , he held conventional views . in 1967 , jensen received a guggenheim fellowship to study at the center for the advanced study in the behavioral sciences in palo alto , california , where he planned to do research for a book about how cultural deprivation depresses the intelligence of minorities . at the center he met a geneticist who persuaded him to study the genetics of intelligence , and this completely changed his views . instead of writing a book , he wrote his famous february 1969 article for the harvard educational review , “ how much can we boost iq and scholastic achievement ? ” in this 123-page article , he laid the foundation for a correct understanding of intelligence : iq tests are valid and reliable , they are not biased against minorities , social mobility means that the genes for high iq are concentrated in higher social strata , and there is a substantial genetic contribution to both individual and group differences in intelligence . there was an immediate explosion ( the best account is roger pearson , race , intelligence and bias in academe , scott-townsend publishers , 1991 ) . the board of harvard educational review came under so much pressure it stopped making reprints of the article—not even jensen could get any . it explained this was because the article “ presents a view of intelligence that we feel must be read in the context of expert discussion from other psychologists and geneticists . ” in many libraries , vandals tore the article out of the magazine and destroyed it . leftists on campus called for jensen to be fired—and worse . in july of the same year , martin deutsch ( 1926-2002 ) , who was involved in setting up head start , made a speech at michigan state university in which he claimed that jensen ’ s article contained “ 53 major errors or misinterpretations . ” this claim was gobbled up by the left despite deutsch ’ s refusal to say what the errors were . in 1973 , he admitted that the “ 53 errors ” was an off-the-cuff answer to a question from the audience , and that he had no idea the claim would be trumpeted by egalitarians . yale was not the only place where jensen was silenced , and police protected him several times from howling mobs that rushed the podium . as psychologist sandra scarr has written , “ i learned what it is like to be spat upon and to put my body on the line to get art out of a university of minnesota auditorium . it was shocking and frightening , as surely the radicals intended . . . . ” at home in berkeley , jensen received so many vicious telephone calls—many late at night—that for a time his family routed all calls through the police station . the police advised him to move out of his house , and he stayed with friends . there were threats against the jensens ’ 11-year-old daughter , and for almost a year the police warned her not to walk the two blocks to the school bus . for several years , jensen filed his movements in advance with the campus police . if he needed to go somewhere , two officers showed up to accompany him . one year , two plain-clothes men attended his class to keep an eye out for thugs . jensen was always cheerful in the face of hatred , but he was bothered by its effect on others : jensen ’ s persecution continued for years . in 1977 he went on what was to be a lecture tour of eight australian universities , along with hans eysenck of the university of london institute of psychiatry . the men were not even going to speak about race—only about iq , personality , and learning—but the left found this intolerable . at his first stop , the university of melbourne , demonstrators tried to keep people out of the lecture hall . when jensen began to speak , they banged on metal bins and chanted : “ what do we want ?

there is no doubt that jensen , with help from such people as hans eysenck , philippe rushton , richard lynn , linda gottfredson , helmuth nyborg , and michael levin , eventually convinced the experts that genes account for 50 to 80 percent of variation in individual iq and contribute substantially to group variation—but they never managed to convince the media . by the mid 1990s , jensen was hard at work on what was to be his crowning achievement , the g factor , but could not find a publisher . a deep chill had fallen over the book industry , and methuen , jensen ’ s usual publisher , and the free press , which had published straight talk about mental testing , would not touch the g factor . jensen had to settle for praeger publilshers , which had a reputation for accepting controversial titles but printing very few copies and selling them at very high prices . at 648 pages , the g factor was an extraordinary work of science , and praeger priced it at a relatively affordable $ 39 . 95 . it was a magisterial investigation of the nature of intelligence , the extent to which it is under genetic control , and its uneven distribution between individuals and groups . after i reviewed it , i was greatly flattered when jensen told me it was the best summary of the book anyone had written , and that he was making copies to send to associates and friends . however , he said the review contained an important error : i had written that when blacks and whites are matched for brain size they have the same iq , but that was a mistake . he explained that when blacks and whites are matched for iq they have the same brain size , but the relationship does not run the other way . there are other aspects of the brain besides size—neurofunction , brain metabolism , etc . —that influence intelligence , and the races appear to differ in these as well . therefore , for blacks to match whites in iq , equivalent brain size is a necessary but not a sufficient condition . i had always heard that jensen prized accuracy . jensen won admiration for his research and analysis , but he was loved for his character . always the gentleman , always the scientist , he never ran from controversy but he never sought it . in 2003 , in cooperation with phillipe rushton and linda gottfredson , jensen ’ s danish colleague helmuth nyborg published the scientific study of general intelligence : tribute to arthur r. jensen . this was a 642-page collection of articles that were both tributes to a great scientist and major contributions to the field . many authors noted that jensen ’ s true love was data . as professor nyborg wrote , “ if art is loyal to data he is entirely unfaithful to theory , ” noting that jensen would readily sacrifice his own theories if the data did not support them . “ give art a proper analysis and good data , ” he wrote , “ and his mind will follow , entirely independently of his previous views , ” adding , “ that is far more than one can say for most of his critics ! ” thomas j. bouchard , who directed the minnesota twin study , has said jensen ’ s scientific work is “ intensive , detailed , exhaustive , fair-minded , temperate , and courageous . ” like all who knew him , prof. bouchard was deeply impressed by jensen ’ s self possession : “ for someone who has been attacked so vituperatively , both in public and in the published literature , i continue to be astounded at the lack of anger and hostility in his replies and the astuteness with which he dissects the arguments of his critics . ” jensen ’ s former students added to the nyborg collection with comments such as : “ the finest examples of college teaching i have ever experienced , ” “ i can not imagine a better mentor , ” “ he showed astonishing patience with his critics , ” “ the toughest reviewer around , ” “ his own thirst for knowledge is infectious . ” in 2005 , together with philippe rushton , jensen published what i think is the best short , academic summary of iq research ever written : “ thirty years of research on race differences in cognitive ability . ” by then , however , jensen was suffering from parkinson ’ s disease . he continued to publish , but his output declined . arthur jensen died on october 22 . his family kept the event quiet , but the news has now leaked out . when a man of his stature dies , even an enemy establishment is compelled to take notice , and it will be edifying to read the flummery that is sure to appear . the major papers will certainly not admit it , but arthur jensen was a great scientist and a man of great dignity , even nobility . in a sane world , he would have been a serious contender for a nobel prize . that his death should follow so soon upon that of his eminent colleague and friend , philippe rushton , only compounds the terrible loss that science—and mankind—have suffered . topics : race and intelligence , racial differences , science and genetics   \n",
       "calderon2021_20818  a great scientist dies when i got to the lecture hall , there was a crowd outside but no one was allowed in . there had been threats of violence and the talk was canceled . most of my friends were happy : the “ racist ” had been defeated . although i was convinced jensen was completely wrong , it seemed cowardly and shameful to silence a man , no matter what his views . it didn ’ t occur to me that i was acting shamefully . i knew nothing about genetics or iq testing—nothing at all—and yet i was convinced i knew better than a scientist who had studied the subject thoroughly . how embarrassing to have been such an arrogant young lefty ! the goons who shut down jensen ’ s talk may have had an influence on my life . it took me 15 years to realize that jensen was right , and that i and the goons were wrong . surely , my eyes would have been opened sooner if jensen had been able to speak , and i had heard the calm , factual , talk he would surely have given . the primacy of datauntil 1967 , when he was 43 years old , arthur jensen believed that differences in iq were almost entirely determined by environment . he had received a phd in psychology from columbia in 1950 , had worked with hans eysenck in london from 1956 to 1958 and also in 1964 , and had become a full professor at uc berkeley in 1966 . he had studied retarded children with iqs lower than 75 and had found racial differences in patterns of mental disability . still , he held conventional views . in 1967 , jensen received a guggenheim fellowship to study at the center for the advanced study in the behavioral sciences in palo alto , california , where he planned to do research for a book about how cultural deprivation depresses the intelligence of minorities . at the center he met a geneticist who persuaded him to study the genetics of intelligence , and this completely changed his views . instead of writing a book , he wrote his famous february 1969 article for the harvard educational review , “ how much can we boost iq and scholastic achievement ? ” in this 123-page article , he laid the foundation for a correct understanding of intelligence : iq tests are valid and reliable , they are not biased against minorities , social mobility means that the genes for high iq are concentrated in higher social strata , and there is a substantial genetic contribution to both individual and group differences in intelligence . there was an immediate explosion ( the best account is roger pearson , race , intelligence and bias in academe , scott-townsend publishers , 1991 ) . the board of harvard educational review came under so much pressure it stopped making reprints of the article—not even jensen could get any . it explained this was because the article “ presents a view of intelligence that we feel must be read in the context of expert discussion from other psychologists and geneticists . ” in many libraries , vandals tore the article out of the magazine and destroyed it . leftists on campus called for jensen to be fired—and worse . in july of the same year , martin deutsch ( 1926-2002 ) , who was involved in setting up head start , made a speech at michigan state university in which he claimed that jensen ’ s article contained “ 53 major errors or misinterpretations . ” this claim was gobbled up by the left despite deutsch ’ s refusal to say what the errors were . in 1973 , he admitted that the “ 53 errors ” was an off-the-cuff answer to a question from the audience , and that he had no idea the claim would be trumpeted by egalitarians . yale was not the only place where jensen was silenced , and police protected him several times from howling mobs that rushed the podium . as psychologist sandra scarr has written , “ i learned what it is like to be spat upon and to put my body on the line to get art out of a university of minnesota auditorium . it was shocking and frightening , as surely the radicals intended . . . . ” at home in berkeley , jensen received so many vicious telephone calls—many late at night—that for a time his family routed all calls through the police station . the police advised him to move out of his house , and he stayed with friends . there were threats against the jensens ’ 11-year-old daughter , and for almost a year the police warned her not to walk the two blocks to the school bus . for several years , jensen filed his movements in advance with the campus police . if he needed to go somewhere , two officers showed up to accompany him . one year , two plain-clothes men attended his class to keep an eye out for thugs . jensen was always cheerful in the face of hatred , but he was bothered by its effect on others : jensen ’ s persecution continued for years . in 1977 he went on what was to be a lecture tour of eight australian universities , along with hans eysenck of the university of london institute of psychiatry . the men were not even going to speak about race—only about iq , personality , and learning—but the left found this intolerable . at his first stop , the university of melbourne , demonstrators tried to keep people out of the lecture hall . when jensen began to speak , they banged on metal bins and chanted : “ what do we want ? jensen ! how do we want him ? dead ! ” jensen could not be heard over the din , and escaped to a basement room , where he continued his talk through a video link to the lecture hall . the lefties then broke into the basement room and ended the talk . after this debacle , three of the other universities canceled jensen ’ s talks outright , and several others allowed attendance by invitation only . only at the university of adelaide was he able to give a public lecture to a packed house . throughout this period , jensen continued to write journal articles and books . he published genetics and education in 1972 and educability and group differences in 1973 . his massive , 800-page bias in mental testing , published in 1980 , demolished the then-fashionable view that iq tests were biased against women , minorities , and poor people . it was so successful among scholars that his publishers urged him to write a popular version , straight talk about mental tests , which appeared in 1981 . i meet arthur jensenby the time of my first meeting with jensen in 1992 , he was a giant in his field , with more publications and citations than virtually anyone else in psychology . he graciously agreed to give me an interview , which went on for several hours and ranged widely over forbidden subjects . jensen told me that by then the hostility had waned and that he was living a normal life . he assured me that his students were surprised at nothing he taught them ; that they could not understand what all the shouting had been about in the old days . when we were not recording , we talked of many things , and i discovered that jensen was like all genuinely accomplished men i have met : he had striking insights on subjects in many fields , not just his own . also , he was not angry at his attackers ; just baffled . why couldn ’ t they just look at the data ?

( it ’ s not trump ) judge robart ’ s veto of trump ’ s travel ban notwithstanding , there is not the slightest question but that the president , in his sole discretion , can choose to admit or exclude any foreigners he likes , based on “ the interests of the united states . ” the clinton administration used the executive branch ’ s broad power over immigration to send a 6-year-old boy back to a communist dictatorship . the courts were completely powerless to stop him . as explained by the federal appellate court that ruled on elian gonzalez ’ s asylum application : “ it is the duty of the congress and of the executive branch to exercise political will , ” and “ in no context is the executive branch entitled to more deference than in the context of foreign affairs , ” which includes immigration . the court acknowledged that elian might well be subjected to “ re-education , ” “ communist indoctrination ” and “ political manipulation . ” ( then again , so would enrolling him at sidwell friends . ) it didn ’ t matter ! sending little boys back to communist dictatorships was the policy of the clinton administration . the obama administration ’ s immigration policy was to ensure that millions of poverty-stricken foreigners would come here and help turn our country into a mexican version of pakistan . when arizona merely tried to enforce the federal immigration laws being ignored by the obama administration , the entire media erupted in rage at this incursion into the majestic power of the president over immigration . they said it was like living in nazi germany ! the most reviled section of the act , melodramatically called the “ papers please ” law , was upheld by the supreme court . but the other parts , allowing state officials to enforce federal immigration laws , were ruled unconstitutional . a president ’ s policy choice to ignore immigration laws supersedes a state ’ s right to enforce them . the court conceded that hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens were arrested in arizona each year , that they were responsible for “ a disproportionate share of serious crime , ” and that illegals constituted nearly 6 percent of arizona ’ s population . but arizona was powerless to enforce laws on the books — if those laws happened to be about immigration . the president ’ s authority over immigration is absolute and exclusive , as part of his authority over foreign policy . to review : — when the president ’ s immigration policy is to promote international communism : the president wins . — when the president ’ s immigration policy is to transform america into a different country : the president wins . — but when the president ’ s immigration policy is to protect americans : some piss-ant judge announces that his authority exceeds that of the president . this is exactly what i warned you about in adios , america : the left ’ s plan to turn our country into a third world hellhole . nothing trump does will be met with such massive resistance as his immigration policies . the left used to attack america by spying for stalin , aiding our enemies , murdering cops and blowing up buildings . but , then liberals realized , it ’ s so much more effective to just do away with america altogether ! teddy kennedy gave them their chance with the 1965 immigration act . since then , we ’ ve been taking in more than a million immigrants a year , 90 percent from comically primitive cultures . they like the welfare , but have very little interest in adopting the rest of our culture . in many parts of the country , you ’ re already not living in america . just a few more years , and the transformation will be complete . there will be a north american landmass known as “ the united states , ” but it won ’ t be our country . the only thing that stands between america and oblivion is a total immigration moratorium . we are well past the point of quick fixes — as judge robart ’ s delusional ruling proves . the judiciary , both political parties , the media , hollywood , corporate america and approximately 1 million lobbying groups are all working frantically to bring the hardest cases to our shores . left-wing traitors , who used to honeymoon in cuba and fight with peasant revolutionaries in peru , toil away , late into the night , to ensure that genocidal rwandans can move to america and immediately start collecting food stamps , medicaid and social security . no matter how clearly laws are written , government bureaucrats connive to import people from countries that a majority of americans would not want to visit , much less become . federal judges issue lunatic rulings to ensure that there will never be a pause in the transformation of america . congress could write laws requiring immigrants to pay taxes , learn english , forgo welfare and have good moral character . it could write laws giving the president authority to exclude aliens in the public interest . except it already has . those laws were swept away by ins officials , federal judges and democratic administrations — under ferocious pressure from america-hating , left-wing groups . the country will not be safe until the following outfits are out of business : the aclu ’ s immigrants ’ rights project ; the national immigration forum ; the national immigration law center ; the national immigration project of the national lawyers guild ; the national network for immigrant and refugee rights ; the office of migration and refugee services ; the american immigration law foundation ; the american immigration lawyers association ; the border information and outreach service ; atlas : diy ; the catholic legal immigration network ; the clearinghouse for immigrant education ; the farmworker justice fund ; grantmakers concerned with immigrants and refugees ; the immigrant legal resource center ; the international center for migration , ethnicity and citizenship ; the lesbian and gay immigration rights task force ; the lutheran immigration and refugee service ; the national association for bilingual education ; the national clearinghouse on agricultural guest worker issues ; the national coalition for dignity and amnesty for undocumented immigrants ; the national coalition for haitian rights ; the national council of la raza ; and the national farm worker ministry . and that ’ s only a small fraction of the anti-american immigration groups assiduously dragging the third world to our shores — while you were busy working . look at that list — look at judge robart ’ s ruling ! — and ask yourself : is it possible that anything short of a total immigration moratorium can save this country ? only when there is no immigration to bellyache about will these nuts be forced to think of a new way to destroy america . topics : donald trump , immigration , immigration law , immigration law enforcement   \n",

                          “ conservatives ” blast trump their writers then get to work . mr. trump is a “ con man ” ( mona charen ) , a “ know-nothing demagogue ” who suffers from “ raging egomania ” ( mark helprin ) , “ the politicized american id ” ( john podhoretz ) , a “ glib egomaniac ” and “ bombastic showoff ” ( thomas sowell ) , a “ political conman ” ( katie pavlich ) , a “ narcissist ” ( cal thomas ) , a harbinger of “ two-bit caesarism ” ( william kristol ) , a peddler of “ know-nothing protectionism , ” “ nativism , ” and “ one-man rule ” ( david boaz ) , etc . you know you ’ ve won the argument when your opponents are reduced to name-calling . but there are a few substantive complaints amidst the roaring . one is that mr. trump is too ignorant to run the country . according to mark helprin , mr. trump “ doesn ’ t know the constitution , history , law , political philosophy , nuclear strategy , diplomacy , defense , economics beyond real estate , ” and so on . this is true of almost the entire political class . ronald reagan and george w. bush were genial ignoramuses , but reagan is a hero to national review . andrew mccarthy sniffs that mr. trump doesn ’ t know who hassan nasrallah is . i doubt mike huckabee , jim gilmore , chris christie or john kasich know who he is either , and ben carson thinks the pyramids were built to store grain . several nr writers think mr. trump wants to be a dictator . david boaz of cato says that mr. trump “ is effectively vowing to be an american mussolini . . . and govern by fiat . ” mr. trump is certainly full of promises about what he will do , but so is every other candidate . they say “ i will ( fill in the blank ) . ” they don ’ t say “ i will persuade congress to pass legislation that will ( fill in the blank ) . ” many of these “ conservatives ” say they worship limited government and the separation of powers , and perhaps they do , but i can ’ t think of a recent president who hasn ’ t attacked another country without a declaration of war , and barack obama has run wild with executive orders . the nr “ conservatives ” may not like that , but why are they angrier about what mr. trump hasn ’ t done than what others have done ? according to their precious constitution , the supreme court and the threat of impeachment will curb mr. trump ’ s imagined excesses . but donald trump is guilty of worse than ceasarism and bombast . national review considers itself the tabernacle of conservatism , and its high priests have declared that mr. trump is not a conservative . they say he ’ s a closet liberal on abortion , gun control , socialized medicine , and big government . for me and for millions of americans , the answer to that is a resounding “ who cares ? ” most of the time , donald trump doesn ’ t even claim to be a conservative . he cares deeply about the well-being and happiness of americans , and is the first major candidate since patrick buchanan who understands that south-of-the-border illiterates don ’ t make good americans . so long as he sticks to that message it won ’ t make any difference whether he ’ s “ liberal ” or “ conservative ” or a conman or a showoff or any of the other names national review calls him . people of all political persuasions will vote for him . there is nothing partisan about wanting your people to survive and prosper . what does the saying “ politics stops at the water ’ s edge ” mean but that when the survival of the nation is threatened we set aside disagreements and fight the common enemy . our survival is threatened , and mr. trump is the only candidate who seems to understand that . but nr ’ s sniffing about mr. trump not being a conservative highlights the most inexplicable and pathetic thing about “ conservatives . ” they don ’ t realize that the one thing that must absolutely be conserved is something they pride themselves on pretending doesn ’ t matter : the race of people who make what they call conservatism even possible . do they really believe that mexicans and haitians and guatemalans and vietnamese and bangladeshis and chinese are ever going to be made to care about the second amendment or madisonian democracy or limited government ? this is why these people are cuckolded conservatives or “ cuckservatives . ” just like a man with a faithless wife , they are lavishing care on somebody else ’ s children . their beautiful constitution and elegant libertarianism are wasted on third-worlders , for whom these things are alien and meaningless . the institutions national review thinks it is preserving will be kicked aside by people whose ancestors had no hand in building them . what cuckservatives are determined not to understand is that without the historic american people , there is no america , no western culture , no civilization fit for white men . anyone who stands for the european people and traditions of america is our comrade , whatever his politics . there is something grotesque about people who sacrifice americans to abstractions , who put principle over people . and if they think that pronouncing donald trump “ not a conservative ” will move the electoral balance by even a hair they are deluded . do they imagine people all across america saying to themselves , “ i was going to vote for trump , but nr says he ’ s not a conservative so i guess i ’ ll vote for jeb bush ” ? liberals are just as deluded about the insignificance of race , of course . their vision of the perfect society requires a population of danes , not mexicans . the only part of “ liberalism ” third-worlders understand is government handouts . feminism , gay rights , “ diversity , ” “ tolerance , ” environmentalism , yoga and fruit-juice drinking–you don ’ t see much of that in “ communities of color . ” but liberals are at least consistent in their madness . they want to change everything , so it is more excusable that they not realize that changing the population makes their kind of change impossible . but back to the anti-trump blasts , i almost forgot : not one of the nr 22 dared call mr. trump a “ racist ” on the record , but there were plenty of hints : “ trump ’ s vitriolic–and often racist and sexist language–language ” ( russell moore ) , “ the unavoidable issue of racism ” ( michael medved ) , and “ racial and religious scapegoating ” ( david boaz ) . keep it up , national review . you ’ re beginning to sound just like the washington post ; dana milbank titled one of his columns “ donald trump is a bigot and a racist . ” when both national review and the washington post agree that the republican front-runner and probable nominee–a man who could well become the president of the united states–is a “ racist , ” we know that a new day is dawning in america . topics : donald trump , elections , immigration   \n",

trump grasps on a gut level . in his last few addresses , obama promised to speak up on “ certain issues , ” in times when he imagined “ our core values may be at stake . ” likewise , in delivering her control-alt-delete speech against the deplorables , clinton had asserted that “ our country is great because we ’ re good . … donald trump disregards the values that make our country great . ” the two ’ s group-think , notwithstanding , only individuals can be virtuous , not collectives . self-government , and not imposed government , implies that society , and not the state , is to develop value systems . the state ’ s role is to protect citizens as they go about their business peacefully , living in accordance with their peaceful values . when you hear an appeal to “ permanent values ” — ” the values that make our country great , ” to quote clinton—know you are dealing with world-class crooks . these crooks want to swindle you out of the freedom to think and believe as you wish . for in the classical conservative and libertarian traditions , values are private things , to be left to civil society—the individual , family and church—to practice and police . the american government is charged purely with upholding the law , no more . why so ? because government has police and military powers with which to enforce its “ values . ” a free people dare not entrust such an omnipotent entity with policing values , at home or abroad , because values enforced are dogma . when incontestable majorities call on government to curb islamic and other in-migration because this imperils american lives , president trump ’ s unswerving opponents—the obama , clinton , ryan , mccain , graham , schumer and media mafia—will invariably intone , “ that ’ s not who we are . ” when you hear that manipulative mantra , tell them to shut up , mind their own business , and stick to their constitutional mandate to protect the people , not police their minds . remember that through an appeal to values , the state aggrandizes itself . a limited government , serving an ostensibly free people , must thus never enforce values . because our form of government is incompatible with the enforcement of values , the american people can ’ t and mustn ’ t welcome into their midst civilizations whose values are inimical to the survival of their own . topics : donald trump ,

boston , orlando , san bernardino , fort-hood and chattanooga dwarfs when compared to the importance of preserving “ our values . ” ( by which obama means his values , hillary clinton ’ s values , angela merkel ’ s values , sally yates ’ s values , chucky schumer ’ s values , jeff bezos ’ s values , john mcmussolini ’ s values , lindsey graham ’ s values . ) when a politician pules about “ the values that make our country great , ” to quote mrs. clinton , chances are they mean multiculturalism , pluralism , wide-swung borders , islam as peace , communities divided in diversity as a net positive , and the constitution—it mandates all the above , just ask ruth bader ginsburg—as a living , breathing , mutating philosophical malignancy . for them , “ protecting ” the abstraction that is “ our way of life ” trumps the protection of real individual lives . “ we must guard against a weakening of the values that make us who we are , ” dissembled obama in the waning weeks before he was gone . the empty phrase is meant to make the sovereign citizen—you—forget that government ’ s most important role , if not its only role , is to protect individual life . this is something president trump grasps on a gut level . in his last few addresses , obama promised to speak up on “ certain issues , ” in times when he imagined “ our core values may be at stake . ” likewise , in delivering her control-alt-delete speech against the deplorables , clinton had asserted that “ our country is great because we ’ re good . … donald trump disregards the values that make our country great . ” the two ’ s group-think , notwithstanding , only individuals can be virtuous , not collectives . self-government , and not imposed government , implies that society , and not the state , is to develop value systems . the state ’ s role is to protect citizens as they go about their business peacefully , living in accordance with their peaceful values . when you hear an appeal to “ permanent values ” — ” the values that make our country great , ” to quote clinton—know you are dealing with world-class crooks . these crooks want to swindle you out of the freedom to think and believe as you wish . for in the classical conservative and libertarian traditions , values are private things , to be left to civil society—the individual , family and church—to practice and police . the american government is charged purely with upholding the law , no more . why so ? because government has police and military powers with which to enforce its “ values . ” a free people dare not entrust such an omnipotent entity with policing values , at home or abroad , because values enforced are dogma . when incontestable majorities call on government to curb islamic and other in-migration because this imperils american lives , president trump ’ s unswerving opponents—the obama , clinton , ryan , mccain , graham , schumer and media mafia—will invariably intone , “ that ’ s not who we are . ” when you hear that manipulative mantra , tell them to shut up , mind their own business , and stick to their constitutional mandate to protect the people , not police their minds . remember that through an appeal to values , the state aggrandizes itself . a limited government , serving an ostensibly free people , must thus never enforce values . because our form of government is incompatible with the enforcement of values , the american people can ’ t and mustn ’ t welcome into their midst civilizations whose values are inimical to the survival of their own . topics : donald trump ,

            “ we ’ ve never been weaker and never more hated ” all the speakers bemoaned the rise of donald trump and of populist groups in europe . all said the “ refugees ” were fueling the right in europe , and that the dwindling white majority in the united states backs mr. trump . they also voiced a growing fear of the internet that gives dissenters a voice . the meeting had an atmosphere of pessimism and gloom that was an almost perfect mirror-image of the optimism and energy of the recent american renaissance conference . the two professors showed slides with facts and figures and photos of pegida marches and the like , while miss beirich spoke without rising from her stool . charles lane , who writes editorials such as “ the dangerous nihilism of trump voters , ” was the moderator , feeding softball questions to the other three . of the 60 or so people in the audience , 45 seemed to be retired white people , with a handful of non-whites and young folks . perhaps that was to be expected ; the four speakers were old white people , too . they seem to have forgotten their obligation to promote “ role models . ” professor michael minkenberg , who teaches at a university in frankfurt , spoke first . he noted that the success of populist parties in europe varies widely , and that they can gain or lose as much as 20 percent of the electorate in a single election . he noted that this is especially pronounced in eastern europe , where political parties are less stable , and may appear and disappear from one election to the next . these oscillations make it very hard to predict what might happen next , he said , but stated the obvious in saying that eastern europe is friendlier to these parties than the west . he expressed deep disgust for the current regimes in poland and hungary , but said nothing about russia . of all the presentations , professor minkenberg ’ s was the least vituperative and the most factual . heidi beirich spoke exclusively about donald trump , repeatedly expressing bewilderment at how “ he gets away with it . ” she said no other candidate in modern times has been able to say such offensive things , associate

            “ we ’ ve never been weaker and never more hated ” all the speakers bemoaned the rise of donald trump and of populist groups in europe . all said the “ refugees ” were fueling the right in europe , and that the dwindling white majority in the united states backs mr. trump . they also voiced a growing fear of the internet that gives dissenters a voice . the meeting had an atmosphere of pessimism and gloom that was an almost perfect mirror-image of the optimism and energy of the recent american renaissance conference . the two professors showed slides with facts and figures and photos of pegida marches and the like , while miss beirich spoke without rising from her stool . charles lane , who writes editorials such as “ the dangerous nihilism of trump voters , ” was the moderator , feeding softball questions to the other three . of the 60 or so people in the audience , 45 seemed to be retired white people , with a handful of non-whites and young folks . perhaps that was to be expected ; the four speakers were old white people , too . they seem to have forgotten their obligation to promote “ role models . ” professor michael minkenberg , who teaches at a university in frankfurt , spoke first . he noted that the success of populist parties in europe varies widely , and that they can gain or lose as much as 20 percent of the electorate in a single election . he noted that this is especially pronounced in eastern europe , where political parties are less stable , and may appear and disappear from one election to the next . these oscillations make it very hard to predict what might happen next , he said , but stated the obvious in saying that eastern europe is friendlier to these parties than the west . he expressed deep disgust for the current regimes in poland and hungary , but said nothing about russia . of all the presentations , professor minkenberg ’ s was the least vituperative and the most factual . heidi beirich spoke exclusively about donald trump , repeatedly expressing bewilderment at how “ he gets away with it . ” she said no other candidate in modern times has been able to say such offensive things , associate with such hateful people , and hold such hateful views , yet still be a viable national candidate . she said one had to go all the way back to george wallace in the ’ 60s to find anything similar . she seems to have missed the ’ 80s and ’ 90s , when pat buchanan ’ s and david duke ’ s candidacies were derailed by hostile media . she ended on a pessimistic note , saying that nothing seems to stop the donald . professor thomas grumke , who teaches at a university in north rhine-westphalia , focused specifically on germany . his main point was that although “ far right ” political parties are not doing very well , “ far right ” social movements such as pegida are . he noted that young people were getting involved , but suggested that this might be only youthful rebellion , and that they may grow out of it . he spoke with great condescension towards anyone who could be attracted to the “ far right . ” professor thomas grumke criticizes his fellow germans for worrying about “ refugee ” crime . the question and answer period was more interesting than the presentations . a south asian man stood up and berated the panelists . he noted that no one on the panel represented the right , or had even tried to understand its perspective . he further noted that “ experts ” like them had been wrong about everything so far this election , so why should anyone listen to them ? at the end , he said he had voted for le pen and was a donald trump volunteer . halfway through the question , professor grumke interrupted him , snidely asking , “ how can you say i was wrong ? we don ’ t know each other . ” as an answer , he sneeringly asked , “ are you an immigrant to this country ? yes ? okay , good luck to you . ” the panelists addressed none of his points and immediately took another question . professor grumke went on to mock the pro-trump questioner a few minutes later , saying : without a hint of irony , miss beirich , whose job is to suppress dissent , lamented that no one talks to people with different viewpoints these days , and that this leads to a loss of civility . she added the usual jab at the racialist right : “ we joke in my office that if we could get these people jobs and girlfriends we might be able to neutralize the movement . ” professor grumke complained about the internet : the audience laughed happily at this caricature . a member of the audience asked : charles lane of the washington post replied : he talked about a reporter who apparently needs bodyguards when she covers populist rallies in germany , and that reporters at trump events have felt unsafe . he then returned to his real gripe : how tragic it must be to feel that you are being beaten by overly emotional , unemployed , basement-dwelling losers with a knack for twitter . needless to say , this is what fuels the censorship of the right on facebook and twitter . the panelists blasted twitter , in particular , and for good reason . dissidents have long known that twitter is a more useful platform than facebook , and donald trump ’ s twitter feed has become something of a legend , with entire essays about it in politico . besides confirming my suspicion of just how much liberals hate us , and how much they hate the marketplace of ideas that comes with the internet , there was one other highlight . to my surprise , miss beirich apparently knows about robert putnam ’ s research on the damaging effects of diversity . she never mentioned him directly , but she must have been thinking of him : on its own , it ’ s not gon na happen ? what is “ it ” ? a multi-culti america ? a miscegenated planet ? no matter how high the costs of diversity–which miss beirich concedes are real– “ it ” must be had anyway . since diversity has bad consequences , government must forcibly make it work so america can get to “ it . ” that ’ s why we need the southern poverty law center , “ hate crimes ” laws , sensitivity training , race preferences , forced integration , “ role models , ” and the endless lies americans tell each other about race . diversity has to be made to work , so we can all get to “ it . ” and apparently the only thing stopping “ it

       "      <td>“ conservatives ” blast trump their writers then get to work . mr. trump is a “ con man ” ( mona charen ) , a “ know-nothing demagogue ” who suffers from “ raging egomania ” ( mark helprin ) , “ the politicized american id ” ( john podhoretz ) , a “ glib egomaniac ” and “ bombastic showoff ” ( thomas sowell ) , a “ political conman ” ( katie pavlich ) , a “ narcissist ” ( cal thomas ) , a harbinger of “ two-bit caesarism ” ( william kristol ) , a peddler of “ know-nothing protectionism , ” “ nativism , ” and “ one-man rule ” ( david boaz ) , etc . you know you ’ ve won the argument when your opponents are reduced to name-calling . but there are a few substantive complaints amidst the roaring . one is that mr. trump is too ignorant to run the country . according to mark helprin , mr. trump “ doesn ’ t know the constitution , history , law , political philosophy , nuclear strategy , diplomacy , defense , economics beyond real estate , ” and so on . this is true of almost the entire political class . ronald reagan and george w. bush were genial ignoramuses , but reagan is a hero to national review . andrew mccarthy sniffs that mr. trump doesn ’ t know who hassan nasrallah is . i doubt mike huckabee , jim gilmore , chris christie or john kasich know who he is either , and ben carson thinks the pyramids were built to store grain . several nr writers think mr. trump wants to be a dictator . david boaz of cato says that mr. trump “ is effectively vowing to be an american mussolini . . . and govern by fiat . ” mr. trump is certainly full of promises about what he will do , but so is every other candidate . they say “ i will ( fill in the blank ) . ” they don ’ t say “ i will persuade congress to pass legislation that will ( fill in the blank ) . ” many of these “ conservatives ” say they worship limited government and the separation of powers , and perhaps they do , but i can ’ t think of a recent president who hasn ’ t attacked another country without a declaration of war , and barack obama has run wild with executive orders . the nr “ conservatives ” may not like that , but why are they angrier about what mr. trump hasn ’ t done than what others have done ? according to their precious constitution , the supreme court and the threat of impeachment will curb mr. trump ’ s imagined excesses . but donald trump is guilty of worse than ceasarism and bombast . national review considers itself the tabernacle of conservatism , and its high priests have declared that mr. trump is not a conservative . they say he ’ s a closet liberal on abortion , gun control , socialized medicine , and big government . for me and for millions of americans , the answer to that is a resounding “ who cares ? ” most of the time , donald trump doesn ’ t even claim to be a conservative . he cares deeply about the well-being and happiness of americans , and is the first major candidate since patrick buchanan who understands that south-of-the-border illiterates don ’ t make good americans . so long as he sticks to that message it won ’ t make any difference whether he ’ s “ liberal ” or “ conservative ” or a conman or a showoff or any of the other names national review calls him . people of all political persuasions will vote for him . there is nothing partisan about wanting your people to survive and prosper . what does the saying “ politics stops at the water ’ s edge ” mean but that when the survival of the nation is threatened we set aside disagreements and fight the common enemy . our survival is threatened , and mr. trump is the only candidate who seems to understand that . but nr ’ s sniffing about mr. trump not being a conservative highlights the most inexplicable and pathetic thing about “ conservatives . ” they don ’ t realize that the one thing that must absolutely be conserved is something they pride themselves on pretending doesn ’ t matter : the race of people who make what they call conservatism even possible . do they really believe that mexicans and haitians and guatemalans and vietnamese and bangladeshis and chinese are ever going to be made to care about the second amendment or madisonian democracy or limited government ? this is why these people are cuckolded conservatives or “ cuckservatives . ” just like a man with a faithless wife , they are lavishing care on somebody else ’ s children . their beautiful constitution and elegant libertarianism are wasted on third-worlders , for whom these things are alien and meaningless . the institutions national review thinks it is preserving will be kicked aside by people whose ancestors had no hand in building them . what cuckservatives are determined not to understand is that without the historic american people , there is no america , no western culture , no civilization fit for white men . anyone who stands for the european people and traditions of america is our comrade , whatever his politics . there is something grotesque about people who sacrifice americans to abstractions , who put principle over people . and if they think that pronouncing donald trump “ not a conservative ” will move the electoral balance by even a hair they are deluded . do they imagine people all across america saying to themselves , “ i was going to vote for trump , but nr says he ’ s not a conservative so i guess i ’ ll vote for jeb bush ” ? liberals are just as deluded about the insignificance of race , of course . their vision of the perfect society requires a population of danes , not mexicans . the only part of “ liberalism ” third-worlders understand is government handouts . feminism , gay rights , “ diversity , ” “ tolerance , ” environmentalism , yoga and fruit-juice drinking–you don ’ t see much of that in “ communities of color . ” but liberals are at least consistent in their madness . they want to change everything , so it is more excusable that they not realize that changing the population makes their kind of change impossible . but back to the anti-trump blasts , i almost forgot : not one of the nr 22 dared call mr. trump a “ racist ” on the record , but there were plenty of hints : “ trump ’ s vitriolic–and often racist and sexist language–language ” ( russell moore ) , “ the unavoidable issue of racism ” ( michael medved ) , and “ racial and religious scapegoating ” ( david boaz ) . keep it up , national review . you ’ re beginning to sound just like the washington post ; dana milbank titled one of his columns “ donald trump is a bigot and a racist . ” when both national review and the washington post agree that the republican front-runner and probable nominee–a man who could well become the president of the united states–is a “ racist , ” we know that a new day is dawning in america . topics : donald trump , elections , immigration</td>\n",

       "calderon2021_125    “ conservatives ” blast trump their writers then get to work . mr. trump is a “ con man ” ( mona charen ) , a “ know-nothing demagogue ” who suffers from “ raging egomania ” ( mark helprin ) , “ the politicized american id ” ( john podhoretz ) , a “ glib egomaniac ” and “ bombastic showoff ” ( thomas sowell ) , a “ political conman ” ( katie pavlich ) , a “ narcissist ” ( cal thomas ) , a harbinger of “ two-bit caesarism ” ( william kristol ) , a peddler of “ know-nothing protectionism , ” “ nativism , ” and “ one-man rule ” ( david boaz ) , etc . you know you ’ ve won the argument when your opponents are reduced to name-calling . but there are a few substantive complaints amidst the roaring . one is that mr. trump is too ignorant to run the country . according to mark helprin , mr. trump “ doesn ’ t know the constitution , history , law , political philosophy , nuclear strategy , diplomacy , defense , economics beyond real estate , ” and so on . this is true of almost the entire political class . ronald reagan and george w. bush were genial ignoramuses , but reagan is a hero to national review . andrew mccarthy sniffs that mr. trump doesn ’ t know who hassan nasrallah is . i doubt mike huckabee , jim gilmore , chris christie or john kasich know who he is either , and ben carson thinks the pyramids were built to store grain . several nr writers think mr. trump wants to be a dictator . david boaz of cato says that mr. trump “ is effectively vowing to be an american mussolini . . . and govern by fiat . ” mr. trump is certainly full of promises about what he will do , but so is every other candidate . they say “ i will ( fill in the blank ) . ” they don ’ t say “ i will persuade congress to pass legislation that will ( fill in the blank ) . ” many of these “ conservatives ” say they worship limited government and the separation of powers , and perhaps they do , but i can ’ t think of a recent president who hasn ’ t attacked another country without a declaration of war , and barack obama has run wild with executive orders . the nr “ conservatives ” may not like that , but why are they angrier about what mr. trump hasn ’ t done than what others have done ? according to their precious constitution , the supreme court and the threat of impeachment will curb mr. trump ’ s imagined excesses . but donald trump is guilty of worse than ceasarism and bombast . national review considers itself the tabernacle of conservatism , and its high priests have declared that mr. trump is not a conservative . they say he ’ s a closet liberal on abortion , gun control , socialized medicine , and big government . for me and for millions of americans , the answer to that is a resounding “ who cares ? ” most of the time , donald trump doesn ’ t even claim to be a conservative . he cares deeply about the well-being and happiness of americans , and is the first major candidate since patrick buchanan who understands that south-of-the-border illiterates don ’ t make good americans . so long as he sticks to that message it won ’ t make any difference whether he ’ s “ liberal ” or “ conservative ” or a conman or a showoff or any of the other names national review calls him . people of all political persuasions will vote for him . there is nothing partisan about wanting your people to survive and prosper . what does the saying “ politics stops at the water ’ s edge ” mean but that when the survival of the nation is threatened we set aside disagreements and fight the common enemy . our survival is threatened , and mr. trump is the only candidate who seems to understand that . but nr ’ s sniffing about mr. trump not being a conservative highlights the most inexplicable and pathetic thing about “ conservatives . ” they don ’ t realize that the one thing that must absolutely be conserved is something they pride themselves on pretending doesn ’ t matter : the race of people who make what they call conservatism even possible . do they really believe that mexicans and haitians and guatemalans and vietnamese and bangladeshis and chinese are ever going to be made to care about the second amendment or madisonian democracy or limited government ? this is why these people are cuckolded conservatives or “ cuckservatives . ” just like a man with a faithless wife , they are lavishing care on somebody else ’ s children . their beautiful constitution and elegant libertarianism are wasted on third-worlders , for whom these things are alien and meaningless . the institutions national review thinks it is preserving will be kicked aside by people whose ancestors had no hand in building them . what cuckservatives are determined not to understand is that without the historic american people , there is no america , no western culture , no civilization fit for white men . anyone who stands for the european people and traditions of america is our comrade , whatever his politics . there is something grotesque about people who sacrifice americans to abstractions , who put principle over people . and if they think that pronouncing donald trump “ not a conservative ” will move the electoral balance by even a hair they are deluded . do they imagine people all across america saying to themselves , “ i was going to vote for trump , but nr says he ’ s not a conservative so i guess i ’ ll vote for jeb bush ” ? liberals are just as deluded about the insignificance of race , of course . their vision of the perfect society requires a population of danes , not mexicans . the only part of “ liberalism ” third-worlders understand is government handouts . feminism , gay rights , “ diversity , ” “ tolerance , ” environmentalism , yoga and fruit-juice drinking–you don ’ t see much of that in “ communities of color . ” but liberals are at least consistent in their madness . they want to change everything , so it is more excusable that they not realize that changing the population makes their kind of change impossible . but back to the anti-trump blasts , i almost forgot : not one of the nr 22 dared call mr. trump a “ racist ” on the record , but there were plenty of hints : “ trump ’ s vitriolic–and often racist and sexist language–language ” ( russell moore ) , “ the unavoidable issue of racism ” ( michael medved ) , and “ racial and religious scapegoating ” ( david boaz ) . keep it up , national review . you ’ re beginning to sound just like the washington post ; dana milbank titled one of his columns “ donald trump is a bigot and a racist . ” when both national review and the washington post agree that the republican front-runner and probable nominee–a man who could well become the president of the united states–is a “ racist , ” we know that a new day is dawning in america . topics : donald trump , elections , immigration   \n",

because government has police and military powers with which to enforce its “ values . ” a free people dare not entrust such an omnipotent entity with policing values , at home or abroad , because values enforced are dogma . when incontestable majorities call on government to curb islamic and other in-migration because this imperils american lives , president trump ’ s unswerving opponents—the obama , clinton , ryan , mccain , graham , schumer and media mafia—will invariably intone , “ that ’ s not who we are . ” when you hear that manipulative mantra , tell them to shut up , mind their own business , and stick to their constitutional mandate to protect the people , not police their minds . remember that through an appeal to values , the state aggrandizes itself . a limited government , serving an ostensibly free people , must thus never enforce values . because our form of government is incompatible with the enforcement of values , the american people can ’ t and mustn ’ t welcome into their midst civilizations whose values are inimical to the survival of their own . topics : donald trump , multiculturalism and diversity   \n",
