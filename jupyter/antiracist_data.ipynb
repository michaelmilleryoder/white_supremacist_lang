As in, to a degree, feeling oppressed keeps you oppressed. Naturally, it would be ignorant of me to say that this feeling is baseless and purely fabricated by her imagination.  Of course racism is real, and so is racial oppression. \\n\\nI suppose that in order to really learn from this experience, I'd like to learn more about my privileges as a white person since, as you so eloquently stated, my perceptions of them often appear as normalcies, instead of the \"perks\" that they really are. I think this suspicion regarding my own lack of knowledge of personal privilege has something to do with why I left the argument feeling like I had done something wrong.</td>\n",

I don't mean to invade space, just want to share something similar. \\n\\nAbout 7 years ago my country had really big protests, lasting for almost the whole of summer. In those protests, there were a lot of people carrying our country's flag, unfortunately did not do much in terms of police brutality. The police responded by carrying flags themselves, putting flags on their cars, water cannons etc. While OP is absolutely right that it is a powerful image, there were also people on \"the other side\" (the other side is very conservative right for context) claiming things like \"how dare they drag OUR flag to THEIR protests and THEIR politics??\". Also, some protesters dropped flags on the ground while being attacked by the police, and that was used by these people and mainstream media to say \"look at them tarnishing the flag by putting it on the ground/stepping on it\" and therefore excusing police brutality even more. I'm not saying that will happen in the US, I don't know much about how the flag is viewed in your country. Just saying that they can in fact spin it very badly if they want to.\\n\\nAlso solidarity and power to you all!</td>\n",

This situation should be dealt with, and speaking with the coach sounds like a necessary measure. Speaking with the guy individually might also start a shift in his worldview, but that's a tough one and requires a very open and vulnerable position from both sides of the dialogue. True change and understanding takes time to develop. One thing is certain though: this cannot be left unaddressed, or it will escalate. I wish you courage in this predicament!</td>\n",

This is exactly what I was hoping for. \\n\\nI mentioned anarchy because I'm in interested how those of us who wish to do away with perceived social/economic/racial hierarchies view things like white privilege. \\n\\nIn response to your question, \"How did her post perpetuate racial oppression?\" I just... i suspect that her acting entitled to being mad at white people because shes black is the sort of thing that probably keeps her oppressed. As in, to a degree, feeling oppressed keeps you oppressed. Naturally, it would be ignorant of me to say that this feeling is baseless and purely fabricated by her imagination.  Of course racism is real, and so is racial oppression. \\n\\nI suppose that in order to really learn from this experience, I'd like to learn more about my privileges as a white person since, as you so eloquently stated, my perceptions of them often appear as normalcies, instead of the \"perks\" that they really are. I think this suspicion regarding my own lack of knowledge of personal privilege has something to do with why I left the argument feeling like I had done something wrong.  \n",

       "34840  Hiya, I'm not black so if it is out of line to speak here, I'm sorry. Feel free to remove my comment. I don't mean to invade space, just want to share something similar. \\n\\nAbout 7 years ago my country had really big protests, lasting for almost the whole of summer. In those protests, there were a lot of people carrying our country's flag, unfortunately did not do much in terms of police brutality. The police responded by carrying flags themselves, putting flags on their cars, water cannons etc. While OP is absolutely right that it is a powerful image, there were also people on \"the other side\" (the other side is very conservative right for context) claiming things like \"how dare they drag OUR flag to THEIR protests and THEIR politics??\". Also, some protesters dropped flags on the ground while being attacked by the police, and that was used by these people and mainstream media to say \"look at them tarnishing the flag by putting it on the ground/stepping on it\" and therefore excusing police brutality even more. I'm not saying that will happen in the US, I don't know much about how the flag is viewed in your country. Just saying that they can in fact spin it very badly if they want to.\\n\\nAlso solidarity and power to you all!  \n",

The host never even pushed back and called bullshit on it, even though it was NEVER EVER claimed that Tamir Rice was doing anything but playing in a park with his toy gun.  \n",

Your teammate sounds like a true and proud racist, not hiding his views and being easily triggered. This situation should be dealt with, and speaking with the coach sounds like a necessary measure. Speaking with the guy individually might also start a shift in his worldview, but that's a tough one and requires a very open and vulnerable position from both sides of the dialogue. True change and understanding takes time to develop. One thing is certain though: this cannot be left unaddressed, or it will escalate. I wish you courage in this predicament!  \n",

My wife overheard another mom at baseball practice talking about a Mexican man they had to do contracting work with at their house.  She made sure to emphasize his ethnicity and stress how worried she was he was going to steal. Small white town in the south.  \n",

But I have worked in non-profit, government, retail, publishing, marketing and freelance.\\nThe thing about not having a job (technically, being underemployed) is that you have less time to object to people’s suggestions about what you should do. The thing about having a job is that you’re so focused on keeping your job that you don’t have space to make improvements.\\nAre Recruiters, hiring managers, supervisors and anyone in power aware of the challenges facing employees? On-the job stress is a leading cause of disease, and with our high stakes economy the stress won’t subside soon.\\nWork alone is neither wholly good or wholly bad. It’s the quality and quantity of work that makes a difference to us.\\nWhen we work in spaces that don’t care about us, beyond what service we provide we feel the effects.\\nI once worked at a non profit that went out of the way to call us on a snow day to announce that employees were expected to come in to their offices. It was a terrible experience, that I railed about to friends and peers.\\nOf course every office has its idiosyncrasies. But management staff is responsible for the culture they are creating.\\nYou can give your employees more work, force them to do extra labor, pile up the burdens in professional and personal interactions but it comes at a cost.\\nIs there a way out??\\nIs there a way to protect the bottom line while providing employees with the quality of experience that facilitates great work and achievement??\\nBy fighting racism in the workplace and in ourselves we can set up the office to be a place where outrageous success is the norm.\\nWhat other experts won’t tell you is that the easy answers last the least amount of time. Some will tout more Foosball tables or free coffee as the answer to work culture problems, but experience will tell you what matters.\\nAs a Marketing and Communications professional I worked for a tiny firm with only two other part time employees. Though my supervisor and I were of the same race, there was a spirit of antagonism between us that reminds me of the more explicit ways that racism happens between people.\\nOur situation was solved by me moving on — but the worst part was that I wanted to be there. I wanted to contribute in any way that was meaningful.\\nAntagonism is just one way that it plays a role in workplace relationships.\\nThere’s also the micro-aggressions. There’s being gawked at when you wear a new outfit, or change your hair and the entire week’s worth of conversation around your hygiene practices after. These are experiences that our white coworkers just aren’t exposed to.\\nThe same problems that come up for People of color can be issues for all of the people you’re hiring. When we don’t realize that racism is in the room that also makes space for tons of other internal and environmental problems in the office.\\nNot only are these discussions rude and disrespectful they are completely unnecessary in the workplace. But they often happen between superiors who are attempting to make a connection.\\nA new culture around how we interact with each other at work has to be established. It should include anti-racism as a tenant.\\nThe same tools that we use to consistently fight the oppressions around us in the social world can be used to fight off stagnation and drama at work.\\nFor more on using intentional practices in the work place visit WRITETHEWORLDFREE.com\\nLearn how to defeat Racism in The World Without Racism.\\nIf this piece was helpful to you please feel free to use these practices in your place of business.</td>\n",

       "      <td>It’s White and Black\\nBlack people are being murdered in cold blood by the authorities.\\nLet’s get this out of the way: I’m a privileged, white male who is done being silent. I can’t speak for those living in the war zone that is modern America, but I can speak to those that I reach.\\nI currently live in Toronto, but I was born in the USA and lived on the east coast, the west coast and in the south. Speaking up has resulted in my being involved in conversations about this topic. This has been great, but it also means I’m hearing the same things over and over.\\nThis isn’t about violence in America. This is about a black man sitting on the ground with his hands in the air, trying to explain to police that he is a care worker for the individual beside him. And he is then shot by a police officer. Why? Not even the police officer knows.\\nThis is about a boy with a toy gun. Shot by police within 1.8 seconds of opening their car door.\\nThis is about a man reaching for his wallet, AS ASKED by the officer approaching his car, and being shot multiple times at close range while sitting in the car with his family.\\nThis is about a preacher having his car break down and a female police officer shoot him and then state, “I’ve never been so scared in my life.”\\nThis is about racism. This is about privilege. The privilege to be stopped by officers and not assume we will be brutalized or shot. The privilege to not worry that our children will be shot by the police. The privilege to ignore what is happening to our black brothers and sisters.\\nThe fact that some of us still don’t understand is partly what is so infuriating to those who are afraid to leave their houses or who stay up worrying that their children make it home from school.\\nWhite parents don’t have to have “the talk” with their children about how to behave so as to increase their chances of staying alive. None of my white friends have had to lecture their children on how to avoid a police stop and if stopped what specific actions to refrain from even appearing to perform.\\nWhite people don’t have to worry about being pulled over by the cops. We can yell, get angry and even STEAL ONE OF THEIR POLICE CRUISERS and they won’t shoot us. But if a black person even objects to being stopped, they are on the ground, tasered and potentially dead.\\nOy. Yes. We are talking about societal use of power to oppress black people.\\nThe police, as a whole, appear to be a well-oiled instrument to achieve this end. Regardless of the skin colour of individual officers.\\nYes. That is correct. Not pertinent. Not everyone is poisoning our rivers and drinking water, but we should likely do something about the ones in power who are.\\nNext question.\\nThis has been covered so many times, in so many mediums and so eloquently by people so much smarter than me. It’s so well addressed that I have to wonder why the question is still being asked.\\nI get that people have questions. I even get that there is confusion on what is happening. But to still be questioning why Black Lives Matter was formed and what it stands for at this day and age make my blood boil and leads me to question humanity.\\nWhy? Because there are only two reasonable conclusions left: that we don’t care or we aren’t listening. And you know what? These are the same fucking thing.\\nBecause if we cared, we would listen to those affected by what is happening. We would use empathy to find our compassion. And we would stop questioning why they are standing up against what is happening to them.\\nThe house on fire analogy: a neighbours house is on fire. We rush over to see people pouring water on the burning house. Do we stop to ask why they aren’t putting water on our house? Doesn’t our house (that isn’t on fire) matter? Or do we pitch in on helping to put the fire out?\\nFirst off, this is bullshit. Black people aren’t just angry. They are scared and lost and fighting for their very lives.\\nBut yes, there are definitely some who are angry. Perhaps it’s because they are being hunted and gunned down by authorities who are then given paid leave and a reprimand before returning to duty with back pay.\\nTo bring up our own experiences as a refute for what is happening to black Americans is the single greatest example of white privilege, ignorance and racism I can think of. I’m sorry if that is harsh.\\nWe can argue with an officer. They can’t. We can go to a pool party in a rich neighborhood without being harassed. They can’t. The cops arrive and use force to remove the coloured individuals. Even when the host is yelling that they were invited guests.\\nWe can walk our dog without fear. They can’t.\\nWe can carry a gun in an open carry state. They can’t. (The liberal in me hates using this argument, but it’s a good one.)\\nIf a white, upper middle class woman was shot in the back and killed by police officers while out walking in her neighborhood, our first question would not be, “What was she doing on that street?”\\nOur first question might be, “What the hell!? Why did they do that?”\\nThat’s a totally legitimate question.\\nWhen we start asking specific questions like why they were running or what did they do to deserve being shot, we are implying that it is the fault of the victim — they must have been in the wrong or done something to deserve what happened.\\nWhat is at stake is not whether a person was doing something right or wrong. The question is whether it is a LEGITIMATE use of force to kill someone when no one is threatened in any way. Police have become judge, jury and executioner. And we appear so very quick to assume they were in the right.\\nIf it is a white person, the police will go to GREAT LENGTHS to apprehend the individual. Let’s take this lovely young thing who was begging the cops to shoot her. She head-butts a cop, tries to steal his gun and then steals one of their cop cars and crashes it. She lives.\\nBut if you are black, you are beyond dead if you try any of that. Hell, you could lie on the ground with your hands over your head and you will still be shot.\\nOkay, people who share my lack of skin pigment, do you still not get it? Or do you just not care?\\nEdited by author to remove a reference that was not legit.</td>\n",

After raising her hand to volunteer, Dr. Cross was asked by the flight attendant if she was an “actual physician.” To add insult to injury, the flight attendant demanded Dr. Cross produce her credentials to verify that she was, indeed, a physician.\\nDr. Cross detailed her disappointment and frustration on Facebook where she noted that she “was sick of being disrespected” as a woman of color. Her story has now been shared more than 48,000 times and received over 21,000 comments. Delta, for its part, indicated that the “experience Dr. Cross has described is not reflective of Delta’s culture or the values [its] employees live out every day.” This response is woefully insufficient and inadequate. Instead of admitting their mistake, publicly apologizing to Dr. Cross, committing to implement non-discriminatory protocols, holding employees accountable for their behavior and actions, and dedicating themselves to changing the culture of their organization, Delta has chosen to defend their blatant and overtly biased practices.\\nWe know that Dr. Cross’s experience of discrimination and bias is neither uncommon nor new. Following her post, countless women of color in medicine and healthcare detailed their stories of bias and stereotyping on Dr. Cross’s Facebook page, on Twitter, and in a variety of articles and blogposts. Dr. Cross shared what female physicians of color experience every day in this country. Their stories must serve as the imperative for change.\\nToday, we proudly stand with Dr. Cross in solidarity and to acknowledge, through these powerful images of Black female physicians and physicians-to-be, #WhatDoctorsLookLike.\\nReena Karani, MD, MHPE\\nAnn-Gel Palermo, MPH, DrPH\\nLisa Eiland, MD\\nJessie Fields, MD\\nMichelle Sainté\\nMéLisa Best\\nJoin us in our commitment for change.

Hope and compassion (and, yes, anger) are steps that can spark action — or at least get us through the fears inherent in taking a first step. They help get us past “what can I do about it?” and “why don’t they fix it?!” — the fear that holds us back.\\nActually fixing the unfixable challenges and reaching the (seemingly) attainable (you know, the things leaders do) takes an actual first step.

       "      <td>Confronting Donald Trump\\nBy Martha Ackelsberg and Judith Plaskow\\n@QueerDEP, @endowmentethics, @JFREJ, #DumpTrump, #WhitesAgainstTrump, @ShowUp4RJ, @IVAW\\nOn Friday, December 11, we were proud to join a small group from Jews for Racial and Economic Justice (JFREJ) in New York City, a New York affiliate of Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ), that responded to calls from the Arab American Association of NY, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, Families for Freedom, Black Alliance for Just Immigration, the Queer Detainee Empowerment Project, and Responsible Endowment Coalition to join in an action to highlight and protest Donald Trump’s vicious and hateful Islamophobic, racist, and anti-immigrant rhetoric.\\nWhile hundreds of people rallied outside the Plaza Hotel, calling out Trump for his Islamophobic anti-immigrant words, others infiltrated the event from the inside — where Trump was the featured speaker at an annual fund-raising event for the Pennsylvania Republican Party. One member of our group who made it inside the fundraiser opened a side door so that a few courageous Arab and Latino organizers from the Queer Detainee Empowerment Project and Responsible Endowments Coalition could disrupt. These protesters burst into the venue, chanting “Mama Mama tell us why, why our people gotta die. Trump is trying to bring us down, attacking people black and brown.” A dozen security guards swarmed the demonstrators and dragged them out, very aggressively. In the process, one of the members, a Latino veteran with a disability, was pushed down a flight of stairs and an Arab woman was thrown to the ground.\\nThen, after about 20 minutes, our group of 8–9 from JFREJ (who had bought tickets for the luncheon and dressed up to “pass” as would-be GOP donors) rose in three different waves. The first group of three attempted to recite a revised version of Martin Niemoller’s famous poem, “First they came for the Muslims, but I did not speak up, because I was not a Muslim…” One after another, they were muscled out by security guards. Then, the two of us stood up and sang (to a Holly Near song) “We are a kind and welcoming people, and we are singing, singing against hate.” We, too, were muscled out by the guards. And, finally, two more of our group recited a passage from Leviticus 19:33 —\\n“When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not wrong them. The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as one of your citizens. You shall love the stranger as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.”\\nIt should not have been surprising — but it was surely significant — to note that those of us who were older, white, and “dressed up” were treated much more respectfully than the younger people of color who preceded us. Indeed, we have learned that, in the days since the event, members of that group have received death threats and threats of sexual violence. None of the older white Jewish folks have had that response to our actions. We are all receiving an additional object lesson in how rhetoric that degrades people leads to greater violence and humiliation against those who have been degraded. Indeed, the people of color who put their bodies on the line in this action were taking far greater risks than we were. [FYI: We all stopped our checks after being tossed out, so we didn’t end up supporting the GOP!]\\nWe have been increasingly concerned — it’s probably more accurate to say, frightened — by the xenophobic and Islamophobic rhetoric, heaped atop continued racist violence in the US against people of color. Donald Trump is only the most visible, and the most media-savvy, of the Republican candidates, who manipulate fears stemming from gun violence, job losses through deindustrialization and outsourcing, climate change, international population displacement, and seemingly-unending wars, to foment suspicion, hatred and bigotry. We recognize the concerns that have led significant numbers of people in the US to support his candidacy. But promoting hatred is not public policy; and it is certainly not a public policy we can support.\\nAs the children and grandchildren, as well as the friends and neighbors, of immigrants and displaced persons, who found in this country a refuge from the hatred and bigotry they and their families confronted in Europe, Russia, Latin America, and elsewhere, we are well aware that vilification of immigrants, and fear of what “they” will do to “us” is nothing new. In the 1930’s many people in the US opposed allowing Jews fleeing Nazi Germany to enter the US, fearful of their being German spies. Tragically, a number of ships carrying Jews who did manage to escape Germany were sent back, and their occupants subsequently murdered in the Nazi death camps.\\nContemporary immigrants and refugees are neither threatening nor destroying this country. On the contrary, most refugees are fleeing precisely the violence that we also oppose. Like other immigrants, they are working hard, often taking low-wage jobs that many US citizens are unwilling to do, and paying taxes to support the rest of us, while they can make no claims for benefits!\\nWe cannot and will not stand by as our Latino, middle-Eastern, South Asian, and/or Muslim neighbors are vilified and made targets of hatred. Trump is the symptom; white supremacy is the sickness.\\nThis is not the country we were brought up to love and admire; nor is it the culture we want to pass on to our granddaughter. We are better than this; much better. It is time to stand up and be counted.\\n@QueerDEP, @endowmentethics, @JFREJ, #DumpTrump, #WhitesAgainstTrump, @ShowUp4RJ, @IVAW\\n�?�}��8�~��</td>\n",

       "      <td>The Banality of White Fragility\\nOr why I’m just tired.\\nThings that do in fact make totally not racist people, appear to be racist.\\nI just finished reading the interview with Phil Anselmo and quite frankly, it is among the most milquetoast banal of self-defenses against the dreaded call of racist that I can’t even be angry. Just like every other White person who has a history or who demonstrates their not-racist views by engaging in racist behavior, who then sort of apologizes, follows by hollering about the PC police, SJW’s or you know anyone who doesn’t like their behavior being “the problem”.\\nIt’s not original.\\nI see this same behavior everywhere. Just recently, a White woman had a full on racist meltdown after being called out for saying what? Racist things. Every cry of how not racist she is, was followed by some more racist talk.\\nThis is the banality of White Fragility. This is how insidious this type of racism really is. It is common.\\nWhile screaming the battle cry of the White person caught saying or doing something problematic, there is almost always a checklist of things they say such as:\\nGo to google and search something like White ally bingo and catch them all.\\nThe point is, there is a pattern to this and I see it everywhere. From when folks like Mr. Anselmo get caught doing something terrible to having to deal with it on social media when strangers decide that they MUST be heard in a conversation, that their be nice to me or I’m not gonna be your ally anymore behavior must be tolerated.\\nThis is average. This is the most basic type of behavior that non-racists deploy when they are challenged. In order to preserve their self-perception as not participating in racism, they employ racist dialogue and often end with something intended as a gotcha. Some grand “proof” of how not racist, they are that often winds up being, well, I didn’t mean it that way so you’re the asshole if you took it that way.\\nPOC see this constantly. Especially when it comes to anything we have to say ever. From the mildest statement something like, hey, that’s really anti-Black can you not? To saying, that was a racist thing to say/do and stop, we are met with this mentality that is a strange mix of cowardice, egoism, some bit of self preservation and unchecked, unacknowledged privilege that comes out in a blaze of terrible bratty words.\\nThese responses tend to remind me of a toddler screaming at you that they didn’t make the mess of the flour, while they have flour all over their faces.\\nMost of the time, I watch it happen. Sometimes I intervene and try to help folks see why this behavior is a problem. However, after a certain point I just don’t see the point in engaging with this particular flavor of Whiteness run amok.\\nWhat do you do when people can’t take full responsibility for the words that come out of their mouths? When there’s a pattern of behavior that points to, a complete lack of personal insight? I could keep at them or I can save my energy for anything else.\\nI have come to learn not to expect change from folks like Phil, the woman I referenced above or any of the countless other White people who are totally not racist but engage in racist behaviors to one degree or another. Like many other POC, rather than raise my blood pressure, I’ve learned when to disengage for the most part. Some things are just not worth my time and energy.\\nEvery time this happens, I have to confess I have the tiniest glimmer of hope. I have the tiny hope that there will be a lightbulb moment and rather than having to read commentary about how if you were offended, you’re the problem (or as I saw in many metal forums, and a few messages about my article about Mr. Anselmo) you’re a pussy/ruining metal/don’t belong if you can’t handle it etc., I wish for a moment where someone is like, hey I did some soul searching/listening/reading/talking to people and I keep doing this and I need to figure out why. I need to work on it.\\nI’d like to highlight a part of the interview from Decibal:\\nI want to correct something here. In talking to other fans of color, one of the things that I see dudes like Mr. Anselmo and a lot of men in the metal community fixate on is the whole thing about being triggered.\\nLook, here’s the real shit.\\nIt’s not about being offended. I find duck boots offensive.\\nThis is more about fostering a culture where I a Black person, do not feel safe. Not emotionally safe but safe in the, I want to go to a show and not assume I’m going to get assaulted. As I said in my original article, the problem is that it’s not a joke to a lot of your fans. A lot of your fans, take that kind of “joke” as a tacit endorsement of their latent or not so latent racism.\\nThe type of safety I want in my music means that I, I can go to a show without an escort. I want the kind of safety that wouldn’t move metalheads from all over to send me private messages offering me safe passage. I want the kind of safety that means, I can enjoy the community.\\nAnd just like every other White person I don’t know intmately, I can only make a judgement based on actions. A history of questionable behavior, is not a one off thing. A history of showing zero understanding of what people like me are saying and just declaring it SJW pussy shit, is a shit move.\\nThere is nothing (and I mean to address the larger metal community as well as some of the edgy folks) edgy or new or creative about racism. There is nothing challenging about holding up the status quo. There is nothing inventive or shocking about doing your level best to uphold White supremacy while claiming allyship.\\nThis finger pointing, tantrum throwing behavior is as common as assholes and opinions. Let’s leave it behind that it is somehow super hardcore and amazing to replicate the same racial or sexual dynamics that exist in the mainstream world over some heavy music.\\nIt’s not.\\nTo wrap up, I’m not even mad at Phil Anselmo. I’m not mad at the metal community for doing what it does. I’m not even mad at the White lady I mentioned up top.\\nI’m tired.\\nI’m still going to enjoy my favorite Pantera songs from behind a veil of double consciousness, I’m still going to have other problematic faces and I’m still going to have to just not think about whether or not my Black self is welcome into the community. It’s not okay, but I’m gonna be all right.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Being a loud black girl.\\nAlmost a decade ago, seated in the passenger side of a car driven by an EU students driving around bustling Johannesburg, I was to learn a lesson I will never forget.\\nThe memory aggravates me so much, and I will hold it as a reminder to myself about the reason why I need to speak up and out.\\nWe were pulled over by the cops who proceeded to ask the driver for her documentation.\\nShe showed them her driver’s licence, upon which she was asked for her passport.\\nShe responded as anyone would:\\nThey let us off, as all was in order.\\nWhat came next is the punch in the gut which still bruises till today.\\nAs we continued on our drive, she said:\\nI can quote it in my sleep exactly as she said it, so seared into my memory it is.\\nFriends, do you want to know what upsets me more?\\nThe fact that I don’t even fully remember how I responded, most probably because it was merely a timid reprimand.\\nShe then proceeded to try to back-track:\\nWorse and worse.\\nNeedless to say, our ‘friendship’ disintegrated shortly thereafter.\\nIt is actually their responsibility to figure that out. Help if you wish/want to/can. But ultimately if someone claims to want to be a better person, then they need to act on it.\\nI don’t have the manual on how best to ‘call people out.’ From personal experience I have ranged from calm and productive discussions, to unpleasant ones which resulted in me being blocked. No love lost. Not one lick.\\nWhenever I publish my pieces on racism/sexism, many times I don’t know if it touches anyone, or will have any effects at all. What I do know is that I am continuously working not to be that timid panderer seated beside a driver who thinks her passport is worth more than an ‘African child.’\\nI will not walk out of the situation feeling like I was the token black friend. You can choose not to respect me, but you will understand that it is not your right to impose your disrespect onto me.\\nI am truly sorry that I didn’t say more back then. I’m sorry I let my fears overcome me. I’m happy and thankful for the black women who speak up, in their lives, and on the internet. You teach and challenge and encourage me to grow.

       "      <td>Dallas\\nOn my way back to the afternoon session of my junior year in high school the rock and roll music from KLIF was interrupted. It was 1963. The President of the U.S. was in a motorcade in downtown Dallas and shots had been fired. I arrived at the small town high school just minutes later. The afternoon classes would not even attempt to be held. The news finally was announced that the President was dead. Tears rolled down my cheeks as well as many other students and teachers. I had driven on that street. Classmates recalled at our 50th reunion last fall that they had picked up books for the school from the Book Depository just days before the shooting. It was a pivotal moment for many of our generation, one we never forgot. Like our parents and the bombing of Hawaii. Or 9/11.  Last evening, 7–7–2016, I was just messing on the computer as there was nothing on TV. All the blogs were read and I wandered over to facebook. ‘WTH is happening in Dallas?’ was on one of the friend’s posts. The answers that followed sent a chill through me. Dallas again with bloodstains on the streets and spread across her name. Again, a single shooter was dealing a demented and deadly message. No one is safe anywhere, anytime. Hate and frustration are the ruling forces for that person. And people, mostly police this time, lay dead or wounded. The minutes went by as the count of injured and dead increased. All at a rally in support of families who had lost loved ones just days before this dark night of retribution.\\nThere seemed to be daily reports of unwarranted deaths. In the heat of the moment or the years of hate building. Mounting in a person’s mind. Erupting into violence against other humans. Hate, retribution, hate, more retribution. People fearing people. Families laid waste. Children without fathers. Parents without a beloved child. Young people cut down before even having a chance at life. Black, Hispanic, Asian, white all covered in blood, hate and anger. How to respond? How to change the direction of all this insanity? Love must win and how can I be a part of that winning? Do I take every gun we own and grind them into plows? Even the one from Great Grandpa Jones? What am I willing to sacrifice in order to make a difference? These are but a few of the questions that are still bumping around inside my head . . . and heart . . . and soul. Today, Friday morning we had made plans to restock our empty pantry shelves after having breakfast at a nearby cafe. The cafe is always filled with the diverse group of folks that inhabit the area where we live. I wanted to get up and hug every person in the room. Just say we can get through this if we band together in love and appreciation of each other. I was chicken, not wanting to embarrass my husband or others in the room. I just sat with tears welling in my eyes, a crack in my voice as I talked to Hubby.  From the cafe we went to a small everything is a dollar type store. Again, I was feeling the urge to hug persons of color in particular. To reach across this enormous fissure in human relations that continues to separate all of us from each other, from life’s fullness. As we stood at the checkout watching the young man check our purchases through, a woman of color joined us in line. I blurted out how I was so saddened by the events in Dallas and the deaths of the previous days and years. She concurred. Then I said the only thing that can get us through this is love. She agreed and we spoke of all the tragic deaths. ‘Would she mind if I shared a hug?’ fell out of my mouth. She opened her arms, we hugged and both teared up. As we were walking away her husband was standing near the door. He was smiling from ear to ear. Hubby did the knuckle bump with the lady’s husband. Then the lady’s husband started to knuckle bump my hand. No, it has to be a hug to pass the love along.   On the way to the car I told Hubby he might have to look out today cause it might happen again. His response? “After 50 years together I’ve learned not to be surprised by anything you do.” I only talked about the need for love to the next checkout person at the next store. No hugs. She was young and oblivious to the needs of this broken world . . . . . . Maybe too simple but a hug is at least a beginning. An acknowledgement of the brokenness and the need for healing.

       "      <td>Halloween in Mayberry\\nI live in a suburb of San Francisco. My town is safe and cozy. It’s known as a great place to raise a kid. Kids frequently walk or bike to school here. I’ve heard locals refer to it as “Mayberry-By-The-Sea.”\\nIt’s also mostly white. It borders Oakland, specifically an historically Black area of Oakland.\\nThis morning, on my otherwise delightful ferry commute into San Francisco, I overheard a group of white people from my town talking about last night’s Halloween adventures.\\nThey were discussing how they felt about a bunch of kids who “weren’t from the neighborhood” trick-or-treating their houses on Halloween. Ultimately, they all decided something like this: “I’m okay with it, as long as they behave themselves.”\\nI was appalled. This was obviously coded racism at its most pernicious. Here’s what I should have said:\\nHow did you know these kids weren’t from your neighborhood? Are you really so involved with the community that you know every kid?\\nI’m ashamed to say this: I said nothing. I heard casual, coded racism drift by me on the otherwise idyllic ferry ride across the Bay, and I said not a word.\\nWhat is wrong with me, I wondered. But I didn’t know these people. I knew that if I’d said something, even as a white person, I would have been seen as overly aggressive; they would have countered with whatever defense racists are using these days, and probably would have believed it.\\nI mean, I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they were talking about a different, specific neighborhood. Maybe they truly were very active in the neighborhood, and most of the kids who trick-or-treated their house were truly kids they knew.\\nBut let’s be real: they were most likely talking about Black children. And they probably had no idea whether these kids were or were not “from the neighborhood;” they just saw Black faces, dressed as dragons or fairies or Pokemon or whatever, asking to participate in a time-honored ritual where kids go around and beg for candy, and thought: “well, okay, as long as they behave.”\\nAs if Black children would behave any differently from white children going door-to-door asking for candy.\\nI MEAN, IT’S CANDY. What child doesn’t go nuts over candy?\\nHalloween is supposed to be the weirdest night of the year. If you welcome trick-or-treaters “as long as they behave,” you are not participating in the spirit of Halloween.\\nAnd also, you’re probably a racist. Fix it.</td>\n",

But I have worked in non-profit, government, retail, publishing, marketing and freelance.\\nThe thing about not having a job (technically, being underemployed) is that you have less time to object to people’s suggestions about what you should do. The thing about having a job is that you’re so focused on keeping your job that you don’t have space to make improvements.\\nAre Recruiters, hiring managers, supervisors and anyone in power aware of the challenges facing employees? On-the job stress is a leading cause of disease, and with our high stakes economy the stress won’t subside soon.\\nWork alone is neither wholly good or wholly bad. It’s the quality and quantity of work that makes a difference to us.\\nWhen we work in spaces that don’t care about us, beyond what service we provide we feel the effects.\\nI once worked at a non profit that went out of the way to call us on a snow day to announce that employees were expected to come in to their offices. It was a terrible experience, that I railed about to friends and peers.\\nOf course every office has its idiosyncrasies. But management staff is responsible for the culture they are creating.\\nYou can give your employees more work, force them to do extra labor, pile up the burdens in professional and personal interactions but it comes at a cost.\\nIs there a way out??\\nIs there a way to protect the bottom line while providing employees with the quality of experience that facilitates great work and achievement??\\nBy fighting racism in the workplace and in ourselves we can set up the office to be a place where outrageous success is the norm.\\nWhat other experts won’t tell you is that the easy answers last the least amount of time. Some will tout more Foosball tables or free coffee as the answer to work culture problems, but experience will tell you what matters.\\nAs a Marketing and Communications professional I worked for a tiny firm with only two other part time employees. Though my supervisor and I were of the same race, there was a spirit of antagonism between us that reminds me of the more explicit ways that racism happens between people.\\nOur situation was solved by me moving on — but the worst part was that I wanted to be there. I wanted to contribute in any way that was meaningful.\\nAntagonism is just one way that it plays a role in workplace relationships.\\nThere’s also the micro-aggressions. There’s being gawked at when you wear a new outfit, or change your hair and the entire week’s worth of conversation around your hygiene practices after. These are experiences that our white coworkers just aren’t exposed to.\\nThe same problems that come up for People of color can be issues for all of the people you’re hiring. When we don’t realize that racism is in the room that also makes space for tons of other internal and environmental problems in the office.\\nNot only are these discussions rude and disrespectful they are completely unnecessary in the workplace. But they often happen between superiors who are attempting to make a connection.\\nA new culture around how we interact with each other at work has to be established. It should include anti-racism as a tenant.\\nThe same tools that we use to consistently fight the oppressions around us in the social world can be used to fight off stagnation and drama at work.\\nFor more on using intentional practices in the work place visit WRITETHEWORLDFREE.com\\nLearn how to defeat Racism in The World Without Racism.\\nIf this piece was helpful to you please feel free to use these practices in your place of business.   \n",

I can’t speak for those living in the war zone that is modern America, but I can speak to those that I reach.\\nI currently live in Toronto, but I was born in the USA and lived on the east coast, the west coast and in the south. Speaking up has resulted in my being involved in conversations about this topic. This has been great, but it also means I’m hearing the same things over and over.\\nThis isn’t about violence in America. This is about a black man sitting on the ground with his hands in the air, trying to explain to police that he is a care worker for the individual beside him. And he is then shot by a police officer. Why? Not even the police officer knows.\\nThis is about a boy with a toy gun. Shot by police within 1.8 seconds of opening their car door.\\nThis is about a man reaching for his wallet, AS ASKED by the officer approaching his car, and being shot multiple times at close range while sitting in the car with his family.\\nThis is about a preacher having his car break down and a female police officer shoot him and then state, “I’ve never been so scared in my life.”\\nThis is about racism. This is about privilege. The privilege to be stopped by officers and not assume we will be brutalized or shot. The privilege to not worry that our children will be shot by the police. The privilege to ignore what is happening to our black brothers and sisters.\\nThe fact that some of us still don’t understand is partly what is so infuriating to those who are afraid to leave their houses or who stay up worrying that their children make it home from school.\\nWhite parents don’t have to have “the talk” with their children about how to behave so as to increase their chances of staying alive. None of my white friends have had to lecture their children on how to avoid a police stop and if stopped what specific actions to refrain from even appearing to perform.\\nWhite people don’t have to worry about being pulled over by the cops. We can yell, get angry and even STEAL ONE OF THEIR POLICE CRUISERS and they won’t shoot us. But if a black person even objects to being stopped, they are on the ground, tasered and potentially dead.\\nOy. Yes. We are talking about societal use of power to oppress black people.\\nThe police, as a whole, appear to be a well-oiled instrument to achieve this end. Regardless of the skin colour of individual officers.\\nYes. That is correct. Not pertinent. Not everyone is poisoning our rivers and drinking water, but we should likely do something about the ones in power who are.\\nNext question.\\nThis has been covered so many times, in so many mediums and so eloquently by people so much smarter than me. It’s so well addressed that I have to wonder why the question is still being asked.\\nI get that people have questions. I even get that there is confusion on what is happening. But to still be questioning why Black Lives Matter was formed and what it stands for at this day and age make my blood boil and leads me to question humanity.\\nWhy? Because there are only two reasonable conclusions left: that we don’t care or we aren’t listening. And you know what? These are the same fucking thing.\\nBecause if we cared, we would listen to those affected by what is happening. We would use empathy to find our compassion. And we would stop questioning why they are standing up against what is happening to them.\\nThe house on fire analogy: a neighbours house is on fire. We rush over to see people pouring water on the burning house. Do we stop to ask why they aren’t putting water on our house? Doesn’t our house (that isn’t on fire) matter? Or do we pitch in on helping to put the fire out?\\nFirst off, this is bullshit. Black people aren’t just angry. They are scared and lost and fighting for their very lives.\\nBut yes, there are definitely some who are angry. Perhaps it’s because they are being hunted and gunned down by authorities who are then given paid leave and a reprimand before returning to duty with back pay.\\nTo bring up our own experiences as a refute for what is happening to black Americans is the single greatest example of white privilege, ignorance and racism I can think of. I’m sorry if that is harsh.\\nWe can argue with an officer. They can’t. We can go to a pool party in a rich neighborhood without being harassed. They can’t. The cops arrive and use force to remove the coloured individuals. Even when the host is yelling that they were invited guests.\\nWe can walk our dog without fear. They can’t.\\nWe can carry a gun in an open carry state. They can’t. (The liberal in me hates using this argument, but it’s a good one.)\\nIf a white, upper middle class woman was shot in the back and killed by police officers while out walking in her neighborhood, our first question would not be, “What was she doing on that street?”\\nOur first question might be, “What the hell!? Why did they do that?”\\nThat’s a totally legitimate question.\\nWhen we start asking specific questions like why they were running or what did they do to deserve being shot, we are implying that it is the fault of the victim — they must have been in the wrong or done something to deserve what happened.\\nWhat is at stake is not whether a person was doing something right or wrong. The question is whether it is a LEGITIMATE use of force to kill someone when no one is threatened in any way. Police have become judge, jury and executioner. And we appear so very quick to assume they were in the right.\\nIf it is a white person, the police will go to GREAT LENGTHS to apprehend the individual. Let’s take this lovely young thing who was begging the cops to shoot her. She head-butts a cop, tries to steal his gun and then steals one of their cop cars and crashes it. She lives.\\nBut if you are black, you are beyond dead if you try any of that. Hell, you could lie on the ground with your hands over your head and you will still be shot.\\nOkay, people who share my lack of skin pigment, do you still not get it? Or do you just not care?\\nEdited by author to remove a reference that was not legit.   \n",

After raising her hand to volunteer, Dr. Cross was asked by the flight attendant if she was an “actual physician.” To add insult to injury, the flight attendant demanded Dr. Cross produce her credentials to verify that she was, indeed, a physician.\\nDr. Cross detailed her disappointment and frustration on Facebook where she noted that she “was sick of being disrespected” as a woman of color. Her story has now been shared more than 48,000 times and received over 21,000 comments. Delta, for its part, indicated that the “experience Dr. Cross has described is not reflective of Delta’s culture or the values [its] employees live out every day.” This response is woefully insufficient and inadequate. Instead of admitting their mistake, publicly apologizing to Dr. Cross, committing to implement non-discriminatory protocols, holding employees accountable for their behavior and actions, and dedicating themselves to changing the culture of their organization, Delta has chosen to defend their blatant and overtly biased practices.\\nWe know that Dr. Cross’s experience of discrimination and bias is neither uncommon nor new. Following her post, countless women of color in medicine and healthcare detailed their stories of bias and stereotyping on Dr. Cross’s Facebook page, on Twitter, and in a variety of articles and blogposts. Dr. Cross shared what female physicians of color experience every day in this country. Their stories must serve as the imperative for change.\\nToday, we proudly stand with Dr. Cross in solidarity and to acknowledge, through these powerful images of Black female physicians and physicians-to-be, #WhatDoctorsLookLike.\\nReena Karani, MD, MHPE\\nAnn-Gel Palermo, MPH, DrPH\\nLisa Eiland, MD\\nJessie Fields, MD\\nMichelle Sainté\\nMéLisa Best\\nJoin us in our commitment for change.

                      Steps to The Unattainable\\nAfter a week of frustration and anger and sadness at the repeating fundamental challenges of living in America — gun violence, racism, xenophobia…ahh!!! — I’m taking a little inspiration from an American author* and an American icon.\\nIs intention or pursuit of a solution enough?Is hope?Or, is anger enough?Or, compassion?\\nIt’s a start, but probably not enough. Hope and compassion (and, yes, anger) are steps that can spark action — or at least get us through the fears inherent in taking a first step. They help get us past “what can I do about it?” and “why don’t they fix it?!” — the fear that holds us back.\\nActually fixing the unfixable challenges and reaching the (seemingly) attainable (you know, the things leaders do) takes an actual first step. More than just an intention, and actual step. Any step.\\nSo, grab onto your compassion, dust off the anger and frustrations, pick up the tools you’ve got at hand, and start walking.\\nI’ll meet you on the stairs!\\n* Dig deeper, and you will find O’Neill is both celebrated and reviled for his own complicated history of trying explore racism and privilege. But, before the 80-plus years of evaluating his motives and methods — he did get the conversation started in the 1920s. Who knows how your efforts will be evaluated…or what sparks you’ll ignite!   \n",

One member of our group who made it inside the fundraiser opened a side door so that a few courageous Arab and Latino organizers from the Queer Detainee Empowerment Project and Responsible Endowments Coalition could disrupt. These protesters burst into the venue, chanting “Mama Mama tell us why, why our people gotta die. Trump is trying to bring us down, attacking people black and brown.” A dozen security guards swarmed the demonstrators and dragged them out, very aggressively. In the process, one of the members, a Latino veteran with a disability, was pushed down a flight of stairs and an Arab woman was thrown to the ground.\\nThen, after about 20 minutes, our group of 8–9 from JFREJ (who had bought tickets for the luncheon and dressed up to “pass” as would-be GOP donors) rose in three different waves. The first group of three attempted to recite a revised version of Martin Niemoller’s famous poem, “First they came for the Muslims, but I did not speak up, because I was not a Muslim…” One after another, they were muscled out by security guards. Then, the two of us stood up and sang (to a Holly Near song) “We are a kind and welcoming people, and we are singing, singing against hate.” We, too, were muscled out by the guards. And, finally, two more of our group recited a passage from Leviticus 19:33 —\\n“When a stranger resides with you in your land, you shall not wrong them. The stranger who resides with you shall be to you as one of your citizens. You shall love the stranger as yourself, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt.”\\nIt should not have been surprising — but it was surely significant — to note that those of us who were older, white, and “dressed up” were treated much more respectfully than the younger people of color who preceded us. Indeed, we have learned that, in the days since the event, members of that group have received death threats and threats of sexual violence. None of the older white Jewish folks have had that response to our actions. We are all receiving an additional object lesson in how rhetoric that degrades people leads to greater violence and humiliation against those who have been degraded. Indeed, the people of color who put their bodies on the line in this action were taking far greater risks than we were. [FYI: We all stopped our checks after being tossed out, so we didn’t end up supporting the GOP!]\\nWe have been increasingly concerned — it’s probably more accurate to say, frightened — by the xenophobic and Islamophobic rhetoric, heaped atop continued racist violence in the US against people of color. Donald Trump is only the most visible, and the most media-savvy, of the Republican candidates, who manipulate fears stemming from gun violence, job losses through deindustrialization and outsourcing, climate change, international population displacement, and seemingly-unending wars, to foment suspicion, hatred and bigotry. We recognize the concerns that have led significant numbers of people in the US to support his candidacy. But promoting hatred is not public policy; and it is certainly not a public policy we can support.\\nAs the children and grandchildren, as well as the friends and neighbors, of immigrants and displaced persons, who found in this country a refuge from the hatred and bigotry they and their families confronted in Europe, Russia, Latin America, and elsewhere, we are well aware that vilification of immigrants, and fear of what “they” will do to “us” is nothing new. In the 1930’s many people in the US opposed allowing Jews fleeing Nazi Germany to enter the US, fearful of their being German spies. Tragically, a number of ships carrying Jews who did manage to escape Germany were sent back, and their occupants subsequently murdered in the Nazi death camps.\\nContemporary immigrants and refugees are neither threatening nor destroying this country. On the contrary, most refugees are fleeing precisely the violence that we also oppose. Like other immigrants, they are working hard, often taking low-wage jobs that many US citizens are unwilling to do, and paying taxes to support the rest of us, while they can make no claims for benefits!\\nWe cannot and will not stand by as our Latino, middle-Eastern, South Asian, and/or Muslim neighbors are vilified and made targets of hatred. Trump is the symptom; white supremacy is the sickness.\\nThis is not the country we were brought up to love and admire; nor is it the culture we want to pass on to our granddaughter. We are better than this; much better. It is time to stand up and be counted.\\n@QueerDEP, @endowmentethics, @JFREJ, #DumpTrump, #WhitesAgainstTrump, @ShowUp4RJ, @IVAW\\n�?�}��8�~��   \n",

With those who ask why, and those not afraid to answer the question.\\nOr to question the answer.\\nI stand with those who admit they have more to learn, and those generous enough to teach what they know. With those who are willing to call it out, even when they are a lone voice in the dark. With those who admit their error, and mean it when they profess regret.\\nI stand with those who know life was not meant to be done alone. And those who let others in, while allowing themselves to be welcomed in. I stand with those who despite all evidence to the contrary, believe that sharing what community can be is worth something.\\nInspired by Tremaine L.

       "66  The Banality of White Fragility\\nOr why I’m just tired.\\nThings that do in fact make totally not racist people, appear to be racist.\\nI just finished reading the interview with Phil Anselmo and quite frankly, it is among the most milquetoast banal of self-defenses against the dreaded call of racist that I can’t even be angry. Just like every other White person who has a history or who demonstrates their not-racist views by engaging in racist behavior, who then sort of apologizes, follows by hollering about the PC police, SJW’s or you know anyone who doesn’t like their behavior being “the problem”.\\nIt’s not original.\\nI see this same behavior everywhere. Just recently, a White woman had a full on racist meltdown after being called out for saying what? Racist things. Every cry of how not racist she is, was followed by some more racist talk.\\nThis is the banality of White Fragility. This is how insidious this type of racism really is. It is common.\\nWhile screaming the battle cry of the White person caught saying or doing something problematic, there is almost always a checklist of things they say such as:\\nGo to google and search something like White ally bingo and catch them all.\\nThe point is, there is a pattern to this and I see it everywhere. From when folks like Mr. Anselmo get caught doing something terrible to having to deal with it on social media when strangers decide that they MUST be heard in a conversation, that their be nice to me or I’m not gonna be your ally anymore behavior must be tolerated.\\nThis is average. This is the most basic type of behavior that non-racists deploy when they are challenged. In order to preserve their self-perception as not participating in racism, they employ racist dialogue and often end with something intended as a gotcha. Some grand “proof” of how not racist, they are that often winds up being, well, I didn’t mean it that way so you’re the asshole if you took it that way.\\nPOC see this constantly. Especially when it comes to anything we have to say ever. From the mildest statement something like, hey, that’s really anti-Black can you not? To saying, that was a racist thing to say/do and stop, we are met with this mentality that is a strange mix of cowardice, egoism, some bit of self preservation and unchecked, unacknowledged privilege that comes out in a blaze of terrible bratty words.\\nThese responses tend to remind me of a toddler screaming at you that they didn’t make the mess of the flour, while they have flour all over their faces.\\nMost of the time, I watch it happen. Sometimes I intervene and try to help folks see why this behavior is a problem. However, after a certain point I just don’t see the point in engaging with this particular flavor of Whiteness run amok.\\nWhat do you do when people can’t take full responsibility for the words that come out of their mouths? When there’s a pattern of behavior that points to, a complete lack of personal insight? I could keep at them or I can save my energy for anything else.\\nI have come to learn not to expect change from folks like Phil, the woman I referenced above or any of the countless other White people who are totally not racist but engage in racist behaviors to one degree or another. Like many other POC, rather than raise my blood pressure, I’ve learned when to disengage for the most part. Some things are just not worth my time and energy.\\nEvery time this happens, I have to confess I have the tiniest glimmer of hope. I have the tiny hope that there will be a lightbulb moment and rather than having to read commentary about how if you were offended, you’re the problem (or as I saw in many metal forums, and a few messages about my article about Mr. Anselmo) you’re a pussy/ruining metal/don’t belong if you can’t handle it etc., I wish for a moment where someone is like, hey I did some soul searching/listening/reading/talking to people and I keep doing this and I need to figure out why. I need to work on it.\\nI’d like to highlight a part of the interview from Decibal:\\nI want to correct something here. In talking to other fans of color, one of the things that I see dudes like Mr. Anselmo and a lot of men in the metal community fixate on is the whole thing about being triggered.\\nLook, here’s the real shit.\\nIt’s not about being offended. I find duck boots offensive.\\nThis is more about fostering a culture where I a Black person, do not feel safe. Not emotionally safe but safe in the, I want to go to a show and not assume I’m going to get assaulted. As I said in my original article, the problem is that it’s not a joke to a lot of your fans. A lot of your fans, take that kind of “joke” as a tacit endorsement of their latent or not so latent racism.\\nThe type of safety I want in my music means that I, I can go to a show without an escort. I want the kind of safety that wouldn’t move metalheads from all over to send me private messages offering me safe passage. I want the kind of safety that means, I can enjoy the community.\\nAnd just like every other White person I don’t know intmately, I can only make a judgement based on actions. A history of questionable behavior, is not a one off thing. A history of showing zero understanding of what people like me are saying and just declaring it SJW pussy shit, is a shit move.\\nThere is nothing (and I mean to address the larger metal community as well as some of the edgy folks) edgy or new or creative about racism. There is nothing challenging about holding up the status quo. There is nothing inventive or shocking about doing your level best to uphold White supremacy while claiming allyship.\\nThis finger pointing, tantrum throwing behavior is as common as assholes and opinions. Let’s leave it behind that it is somehow super hardcore and amazing to replicate the same racial or sexual dynamics that exist in the mainstream world over some heavy music.\\nIt’s not.\\nTo wrap up, I’m not even mad at Phil Anselmo. I’m not mad at the metal community for doing what it does. I’m not even mad at the White lady I mentioned up top.\\nI’m tired.\\nI’m still going to enjoy my favorite Pantera songs from behind a veil of double consciousness, I’m still going to have other problematic faces and I’m still going to have to just not think about whether or not my Black self is welcome into the community. It’s not okay, but I’m gonna be all right.   \n",

passenger side of a car driven by an EU students driving around bustling Johannesburg, I was to learn a lesson I will never forget.\\nThe memory aggravates me so much, and I will hold it as a reminder to myself about the reason why I need to speak up and out.\\nWe were pulled over by the cops who proceeded to ask the driver for her documentation.\\nShe showed them her driver’s licence, upon which she was asked for her passport.\\nShe responded as anyone would:\\nThey let us off, as all was in order.\\nWhat came next is the punch in the gut which still bruises till today.\\nAs we continued on our drive, she said:\\nI can quote it in my sleep exactly as she said it, so seared into my memory it is.\\nFriends, do you want to know what upsets me more?\\nThe fact that I don’t even fully remember how I responded, most probably because it was merely a timid reprimand.\\nShe then proceeded to try to back-track:\\nWorse and worse.\\nNeedless to say, our ‘friendship’ disintegrated shortly thereafter.\\nIt is actually their responsibility to figure that out. Help if you wish/want to/can. But ultimately if someone claims to want to be a better person, then they need to act on it.\\nI don’t have the manual on how best to ‘call people out.’ From personal experience I have ranged from calm and productive discussions, to unpleasant ones which resulted in me being blocked. No love lost. Not one lick.\\nWhenever I publish my pieces on racism/sexism, many times I don’t know if it touches anyone, or will have any effects at all. What I do know is that I am continuously working not to be that timid panderer seated beside a driver who thinks her passport is worth more than an ‘African child.’\\nI will not walk out of the situation feeling like I was the token black friend. You can choose not to respect me, but you will understand that it is not your right to impose your disrespect onto me.\\nI am truly sorry that I didn’t say more back then. I’m sorry I let my fears overcome me. I’m happy and thankful for the black women who speak up, in their lives, and on the internet. You teach and challenge and encourage me to grow.

It was 1963. The President of the U.S. was in a motorcade in downtown Dallas and shots had been fired. I arrived at the small town high school just minutes later. The afternoon classes would not even attempt to be held. The news finally was announced that the President was dead. Tears rolled down my cheeks as well as many other students and teachers. I had driven on that street. Classmates recalled at our 50th reunion last fall that they had picked up books for the school from the Book Depository just days before the shooting. It was a pivotal moment for many of our generation, one we never forgot. Like our parents and the bombing of Hawaii. Or 9/11.  Last evening, 7–7–2016, I was just messing on the computer as there was nothing on TV. All the blogs were read and I wandered over to facebook. ‘WTH is happening in Dallas?’ was on one of the friend’s posts. The answers that followed sent a chill through me. Dallas again with bloodstains on the streets and spread across her name. Again, a single shooter was dealing a demented and deadly message. No one is safe anywhere, anytime. Hate and frustration are the ruling forces for that person. And people, mostly police this time, lay dead or wounded. The minutes went by as the count of injured and dead increased. All at a rally in support of families who had lost loved ones just days before this dark night of retribution.\\nThere seemed to be daily reports of unwarranted deaths. In the heat of the moment or the years of hate building. Mounting in a person’s mind. Erupting into violence against other humans. Hate, retribution, hate, more retribution. People fearing people. Families laid waste. Children without fathers. Parents without a beloved child. Young people cut down before even having a chance at life. Black, Hispanic, Asian, white all covered in blood, hate and anger. How to respond? How to change the direction of all this insanity? Love must win and how can I be a part of that winning? Do I take every gun we own and grind them into plows? Even the one from Great Grandpa Jones? What am I willing to sacrifice in order to make a difference? These are but a few of the questions that are still bumping around inside my head . . . and heart . . . and soul. Today, Friday morning we had made plans to restock our empty pantry shelves after having breakfast at a nearby cafe. The cafe is always filled with the diverse group of folks that inhabit the area where we live. I wanted to get up and hug every person in the room. Just say we can get through this if we band together in love and appreciation of each other. I was chicken, not wanting to embarrass my husband or others in the room. I just sat with tears welling in my eyes, a crack in my voice as I talked to Hubby.  From the cafe we went to a small everything is a dollar type store. Again, I was feeling the urge to hug persons of color in particular. To reach across this enormous fissure in human relations that continues to separate all of us from each other, from life’s fullness. As we stood at the checkout watching the young man check our purchases through, a woman of color joined us in line. I blurted out how I was so saddened by the events in Dallas and the deaths of the previous days and years. She concurred. Then I said the only thing that can get us through this is love. She agreed and we spoke of all the tragic deaths. ‘Would she mind if I shared a hug?’ fell out of my mouth. She opened her arms, we hugged and both teared up. As we were walking away her husband was standing near the door. He was smiling from ear to ear. Hubby did the knuckle bump with the lady’s husband. Then the lady’s husband started to knuckle bump my hand. No, it has to be a hug to pass the love along.   On the way to the car I told Hubby he might have to look out today cause it might happen again. His response? “After 50 years together I’ve learned not to be surprised by anything you do.” I only talked about the need for love to the next checkout person at the next store. No hugs.

My town is safe and cozy. It’s known as a great place to raise a kid. Kids frequently walk or bike to school here. I’ve heard locals refer to it as “Mayberry-By-The-Sea.”\\nIt’s also mostly white. It borders Oakland, specifically an historically Black area of Oakland.\\nThis morning, on my otherwise delightful ferry commute into San Francisco, I overheard a group of white people from my town talking about last night’s Halloween adventures.\\nThey were discussing how they felt about a bunch of kids who “weren’t from the neighborhood” trick-or-treating their houses on Halloween. Ultimately, they all decided something like this: “I’m okay with it, as long as they behave themselves.”\\nI was appalled. This was obviously coded racism at its most pernicious. Here’s what I should have said:\\nHow did you know these kids weren’t from your neighborhood? Are you really so involved with the community that you know every kid?\\nI’m ashamed to say this: I said nothing. I heard casual, coded racism drift by me on the otherwise idyllic ferry ride across the Bay, and I said not a word.\\nWhat is wrong with me, I wondered. But I didn’t know these people. I knew that if I’d said something, even as a white person, I would have been seen as overly aggressive; they would have countered with whatever defense racists are using these days, and probably would have believed it.\\nI mean, I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe they were talking about a different, specific neighborhood. Maybe they truly were very active in the neighborhood, and most of the kids who trick-or-treated their house were truly kids they knew.\\nBut let’s be real: they were most likely talking about Black children. And they probably had no idea whether these kids were or were not “from the neighborhood;” they just saw Black faces, dressed as dragons or fairies or Pokemon or whatever, asking to participate in a time-honored ritual where kids go around and beg for candy, and thought: “well, okay, as long as they behave.”\\nAs if Black children would behave any differently from white children going door-to-door asking for candy.\\nI MEAN, IT’S CANDY. What child doesn’t go nuts over candy?\\nHalloween is supposed to be the weirdest night of the year. If you welcome trick-or-treaters “as long as they behave,” you are not participating in the spirit of Halloween.\\nAnd also, you’re probably a racist. Fix it.   \n",

       "      <td>America is facing its most severe domestic threat ever!\\nThe president and Republican Party have embraced white supremacy! White supremacists foster hate speech, not free speech and as such do not have a platform to speak based on the founding principles of America.\\nThe president is a white supremacist and even Paul Ryan said so when he stated that when Trump stated a Hispanic descendant judge (born in Indiana!) could not do his job because he was Mexican and we are building a wall between the US and Mexico defines racism. I would go further and say that calling an American citizen a Mexican because his name and skin color is also racist.\\nA black protestor was beaten at one of his campaign rallies for having a poster that stated “Black lives matter” and Trump’s response was “maybe he should have been ruffed up.” This has happened to hispanics as well during the campaign and now several dark skinned people have been killed in Kansas City and Seattle because they don’t belong in America. These were American citizens killed because of their skin color by crazy white supremacists and Trump has not blinked an eye. A statistical analyst company found that in 2015, 30% of the retweets done by Trump were from white supremacist origins! This is why the white supremacist leaders think of Trump as one of them, because he is!\\nEvery white supremacist leader has voiced that Trump is one of us and rallied their people to his defense in the real world and online. These people think that because someone has a white dick they are superior to everyone else. I am sorry, but neither the dick genes nor white skin pigment ones are linked to intelligence, dedication, effort, talent, etc.. So, the data says these people are wrong and by desiring inequality defines anti-American values.\\nThis anti-American faction is united and a major force within the Republican Party, led by our very president. The discrimination, hatred, and inequality the Republican Party is accepting is the biggest domestic threat to American values ever because of the power galvanized and being wielded against equality.\\nI take this personally as many Americans should! My great grandparents immigrated from Ireland. I don’t know if they came legally or not. During the Irish potato famine many immigrants came here from Ireland because it was that or starve for many of them. They were literally and metaphorically hungrier than the people already here and would work harder for less wages and like today hated for the thought that they were taking jobs away from Americans. Bullshit! This was and is fear based discrimination and anti-American!\\nAmerica is about favoring those willing and able to be smarter and work harder! That is why we have the best most innovative companies, universities, and workers in the world! Depriving an immigrant or girl, or dark skinned person or anyone of having a fair shake to see what they can do and whether they can succeed better than others is what the American dream is about. White supremacists and now the Republican Party are spinning marketing messages to hide that plain, simple truth.</td>\n",

My thought, prayers, and actions are with my Jewish brothers and sisters.\\nSystemic injustice, structural racism, threats for existing, and violence from law enforcement against Black/Brown people are disgraceful. The missing and murdered Indigenous women and the inhumane treatment of people at the southern US border are shameful. The Islamophobia, targeting, and oppression of Muslims are lamentable.\\nNo human life is greater or more valuable than the next and we should condemn all forms of hate and protect humanity. Our lives are all interconnected whether we are conscious of it or not, what impacts one, impacts us all at varying degrees.\\nWe must understand that our freedom as Jewish people are inextricably tied to the liberty, justice, and equity of other humans. In order to combat anti-Semitism, we must first do the following internal and inter-community work:\\n1) Our Jewish community is very diverse. We must embrace and respect the various levels of Torah observances within our community. We must stand by Hasidic Jews and also be in solidarity with Reform Jews. We must accept all Jewish sects and love another without condition.\\n2) We must examine ourselves and our community. We must truly live our Jewish values and DO Jewish. We must have compassion, empathy, and care for our fellow Jew who may be in need. We must care for our home and community, first, in order to be a strong united team to fight hate together.\\n3) We must eradicate the segregation / exclusion, anti-Blackness, and antiSemitism within our own community. We must understand how we may be unconsciously biased, and how we participate in and benefit from racism and oppression. Diversity is our strength and as our Jewish community continues to become more racially diverse, we must include racial and gender representation. Diversity should be reflected throughout our community and in our organizations. Black, Asian, Mizrahi, Indigenous, and Latinx Jews should be leaders of organizations, serving on Boards of Directors, and managing programs. They should not be discriminated or retaliated against, muted, or ostracized for holding the mirror to our community, instead they should be embraced and invited to participate in the transformation that is needed to make our community more inclusive and equitable for all Jews. In order to create more harmony in our own community, we must balance and distribute the power and influence to other non-White Jews. We must evolve our community to embrace diversity and we must all personally do the work to be better mensches. When we change… the system changes. When individuals DO better, racism, bigotry, and hate are eradicated.\\nWe need to address our inter-community issues first, then we can be a stronger team to address antiSemitism and racism externally. It is imperative to accept and celebrate the diversity in the Jewish community, because when everyone feels apart of the commUNITY, respect, trust, and solidarity flourishes. It is also critical to our very existence to stand together as one, not divided in religious sects, colors, races, genders, lifestyles, incomes, etc., but united as a diverse community holding one another with love.\\nAs we continue to self reflect and do what we can to protect our lives, we must also start to do the work to abolish racism AND antiSemitism. Below are a few ways we can protect our safety, freedom, and existence:\\n1) Education:\\n* Learning about other people, their history, culture, and societal issues that impact them, help to combat ignorance and biases. When we understand other people we can create a better connection to effectively partner with them and solve problems together.\\n* Self study and self help are also important to personally evolve to be an empathetic person who respects differences. Reading books to understand unconscious racism, micro-aggressions, equity, systemic racism, antiSemitism, and implicit biases all help to create awareness related to issues that impact others and possibly ourselves. We can learn how we can do better to ensure the world is a better place for all people.\\n* Educating our youth regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion is important to ensure a better future. Teaching them by example and by study is critical to their development as a leader who lives our Jewish values. The youth are watching and learning from our words, actions, and inactions. When we are complicit regarding hateful comments, gestures, and bigoted actions, we teach our youth. We must immediately address the issue and teach them to be respectful of differences. We must teach them how to be better and have open and honest dialogue with them about current events, societal issues, fragility, privilege, and white supremacy. We must monitor their exposure to media that may demonize one group of people and correct the false information that is shared that may result in hateful thoughts and actions toward others. Teaching youth to value and celebrate diversity should be consistent and embedded in the school curriculum, Sunday school lessons, religious studies, and addressed throughout spring and summer camps. Our youth must understand history, Jewish relations in US and around the world, and the experiences of other people (genocide, apartheid, Jim Crow laws, colonization, etc.). Youth should also participate in activities to expose them to different people and attend trips to explore cultures around the world. Consider reading The Global Purpose Approach to learn more about ways to engage youth in diversity and cross cultural education.\\n2) Intersectional social justice:\\nTikkun Olam and Tzedek must be intersectional. We must not only do what benefits Jews, but the lives of other non-Jews. We must support Black lives as they suffer chronic injustices and inequities. We must protest the cruelty of human life and advocate for immigrant rights, we must protect and care for our Muslim brothers and sisters oppressed and persecuted all around the world. We must stand in solidarity with other communities and work with them to improve their circumstances. When we support other issues that do not directly impact us, we build commUNITY with others. We create stronger human relations that reduce ignorance, intolerance, and bigotry.\\n3) Legislation\\nWe must support ordinances, policies, and laws (local, state, &amp; federal) that protect the rights of humans. We must advocate for hate crimes bill and ending mass incarceration. We must be conscious of fighting for laws that protect our community, without putting other people’s human and civil rights at risk. We must not only support laws that benefit us, but support laws that can help improve the lives of people different from us (immigration, reparations, gentrification, equitable education, etc.).\\n4) Representation &amp; Inclusion:\\nWe must ensure diversity inclusion within our community and create events/programs that include other people who may be different from us. When we create open community wide events embracing non-Jews, we should ensure representation from various races, cultures, and religions (not only Muslims and Christians, but Buddhists, Sikhs, Hindus, etc.). Working with Asian, Black, Latinx, Indigenous, LGBTQIAP, Mizrahi, Israelis, Palestinians, and disabled people is important to create a bridge for better understanding and teamwork. We demonstrate respect for others as we work through the conflicts that may arise and as we consciously explore commUNITY together. We should also engage diversity in the planning, programming, and promotions of open community-wide events. We should understand the similarities between various religious holidays/celebrations and consider joint events to celebrate our diversity. We should have engagements that foster brave conversations to build awareness and empathy. Working on joint projects, initiatives, legislation, and doing community service together will also create strong bonds connecting our communities and reducing the fear that breeds hate.\\n5) Black and Jewish relations:\\nJewish and Black communities have a long history of collaboration especially during the Civil Rights Movement. This history serves as a good foundation for how we should work together today on issues impacting both communities. We should understand the context of the historical tension between Blacks and Jews and study the current day impact. Many Blacks believe they are hated by non-Black Jews and some Jews are subjected to antiSemitism by Black people. We should investigate and explore the root cause of hate from both sides. We should be factual, objective, and authentic as we engage with one another to build a strong commUNITY. Transparent discussions are critical and Black Jews should be included in leading these conversations with Black people and White Jews. The conversations should result in strategic actions that ensure sustainable transformation. Black and Jewish coalitions should be revised to include the leadership of Black Jews. Jews should learn more about and support the current Black Lives Matter Movement. Jews should take actions to end structural racism that is destroying lives and the ability for Black people to equitably thrive. Black people should learn more about Jews and take actions to end antiSemitism. Swiftly condemning all acts of violence and terrorism, also demonstrate compassion and solidarity. Co-organizing, collaborating, and courageous conversations are important to reducing fear, distrust, intolerance, disrespect, and ignorance. Blacks and Jews have a shared history that intersects centuries ago. We are more connected than we may even realize, we are one in the same. It behooves us to join in the effort of eradicating bigotry that impacts us all.\\nCombating antiSemitism requires internal work within ourselves and our community first. Then it requires education, exposure, experiences, and collaboration with others. We must do all we can to protect ourselves, our families, and our community. We must also engage and seek common ground with others. We must unite to work on issues that are mutually beneficial and transformative.\\nI really hope for a better world, I hope we can all unite to fight hate and abolish all forms of bigotry. As we start the New Year 2020, may we start to take dedicated actions to make our communities stronger, safer, and more united than ever before.</td>\n",

       "      <td>How to Avoid Being Called Racist This Halloween Season\\nWe’re now in the scary season, gals and ghouls! Bust out your Halloween’s finest, blast a classic Halloween song and get into the spooky spirit.\\nI don’t know about you, but I love Halloween! It’s my favorite unofficial holiday, and it happens in my favorite season, fall. I love visiting pumpkin patches (also known as Vons) and picking out the biggest pumpkin in the batch. I enjoy dressing up in my best glamorous drag or as a less elaborate Mortal Kombat character. And it warms my heart as I hand out candies to five-year-old trick or treaters in adorable costumes.\\nAlthough the season is meant to be fun, spirited, we’re bound to encounter people who take it too far in the costume department. People’s lack of care and problematic racial and cultural sensibilities reveal themselves and create a mockery out of the so-called costumes they adorn. Karen will dress up with an Indigenous headdress; Chad will wear blackface, and Becky will style her hair in cornrows.\\nInevitably, and as if reading a script, the response to being called out is some variety of “it’s just a costume, what’s the big deal?” and “this is cultural appreciation.” However, there’s a difference between cultural appreciation and cultural appropriation. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, appropriation is defined as the following:\\nThere are vast examples of appropriation across the globe and especially within American society. For instance, the use of Indigenous people as football mascots is one of them. The entire British Museum collection is another, and even more highly contentious, the use of African American English Vernacular (AAVE) by non-Black people. Still, appropriation often masquerades as “appreciation” and does so with unbridled entitlement.\\nOn the other hand, appreciation is a practice that includes a mutual and beneficial exchange between two different cultures. Unfortunately, American whiteness does not have a strong track record of ethically engaging with other cultures. In fact, its historical record shows a violent past that intentionally tried to wipe out Indigenous cultures and subsumed white ethnic cultures to hoard power and privilege. How does the past influence the present? Well, whiteness has created a condition where people seemingly want to engage with bits and pieces of, say, Black culture, but without actual Black people. That’s why white people are seen as “cool” when they adopt AAVE, but Black people are criminalized for it.\\nIn a racialized society like ours, we have to be critical about how we engage with other cultures to not perpetuate white supremacy and racism. So, without further ado, here are some Halloween “costumes” to avoid, so you aren’t labeled a racist:\\nDo NOT dress up as a Black person, period. It doesn’t matter if you’re going for a beloved Black character on television. There’s a long list of people who’ve dressed up as Black people for Halloween, and they’ve all been incredibly offensive and anti-Black. In 2013, Dancing with the Stars alum Julianne Hough perpetuated racist behavior by dressing up as Crazy Eyes — a Black character on Orange Is the New Black. In addition to appropriating the Black character’s hairstyle, she darkened her skin with make-up and wore blackface.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, history matters and whiteness has a grotesque past that includes mocking Blackness and Black people. Though Hough claimed that it wasn’t her intention to offend anyone, she evoked the same white supremacy and racism that seared minstrel shows into the American legacy. Her portrayal of a Black woman was a modern-day version of the minstrelsy of yesteryear.\\nThe main objective of 20th-century minstrel shows was to intentionally ridicule Black people, including sporting blackface and over-exaggerating mannerisms. Minstrelsy was birthed out of white supremacy and racism; therefore, we cannot separate the parts that make it up from its history and claim today that there was no malintent.\\nIn my personal and humble opinion, there is no ethical way for a white person to dress up as a Black person. If we don’t understand the psychological violence of past white supremacy and racism, we will not recognize their evolved manifestations today.\\nDo NOT dress up as The Black Lives Matter (BLM) Movement. The BLM movement originates from an organization that sadly has to convince the larger population that systemic anti-Black violence is a problem. Though 2020 was a monumental year for the organization, the movement has gradually built momentum since its inception in 2015.\\nIf you want to show solidarity with BLM, there’s a myriad of ways one can do this — at the core, they all converge around organizing with BLM and its supporters. For instance, AWARE-LA is a white antiracist organization that works collectively with BLM LA. It organizes white people in the struggle against white supremacy and racism, among many other problematic systems. Dressing up as some version of BLM minimizes the hard work and efforts of Black organizers and demonstrates a performative act of solidarity.\\nChasing clout and allyship brownie points are not the way to go whether it’s Halloween season or not. If we want to support BLM, the best way to do that is through tangible action, not silly seasonal regalia.\\nDo NOT dress up as a Native/Indigenous person. All too often, Indigenous property (including offensive imitations) are used as Halloween costumes and music festival attire. It’s an incredibly insulting demonstration of contempt for what Indigenous people have suffered. Indigenous people of the Americas were violently stripped of their lands, language, and culture. They were also coerced by white settlers to live on reservations, which eerily parallel concentration camps.\\nYou’ve likely seen the white teacher secretly recorded by a student as she portrayed a stereotypical caricature of an Indigenous person. The math teacher distastefully performed a mnemonic technique to help her students remember three essential trigonometry functions: sine, cosine, and tangent. She ran around the classroom shouting “SohCahToa” and prayed to the “wind” and “rock gods.” Since the spectacle became viral, the teacher has been placed on administrative leave, and the school has issued a statement where they professed “[the math teacher’s] actions do not represent the values of our district.” Ironically and predictably, her actions have been consistent since 2012 — perhaps longer, but we may not know — and the school has tacitly supported her behavior.\\nAlthough the math teacher is a vulgar example, the offensive portrayal of Indigeneity on white bodies adds salt to an old wound. It’s uncouth to cosplay as Indigenous people and violent to mock Indigeneity, especially as white people continue to capitalize on the theft of Indigenous land.\\nThough this list is not exhaustive, it’s essential to recognize that a “cool” costume to some may be a Halloween nightmare to others. If you have doubts about this year’s outfit of choice, that’s a great place to start. I think we should have a checks and balances system when it comes to potentially offensive costumes. After all, given the racist history of whiteness, appreciation and admiration can quickly become appropriation.\\nBottom line, when in doubt, just dress up like a bunny.\\nJoey Pierre is a race &amp; class researcher, scholar, writer, and an amateur astronomer.

       "      <td>[ESSAY] How the “Unite The Right” rally emerged out of the college campus speaker debate\\nThere is no distinction between giving someone who hates you a platform on which to speak inside a lecture hall or out in public. As much resistance and criticism that we show toward the terrorists in Charlottesville, we should also show to the propagandists who come to speak on our college campuses.\\nAfter a full day of rest, I have amassed the energy to speak on the white supremacist, anti-black violence occurring not only in Charlottesville, Va but elsewhere. The ongoing attacks upon black people, non-black people of color, immigrants, womyn, non-white queer and trans folks are indicative of a historical valuation in favor of whiteness: white children, white values, white women, white entrepreneurship, predominately white institutions, white wealth, white Whole Foods, white bread, white aesthetics, white teeth, OVER the valuation of black lives. It is infuriating, but if you have been paying attention at all in the last eight months, this moment is not exceptional. It comes as no surprise. It shocks me none. This moment represents what I already know: I am not particularly welcomed or loved in this country. A country of so-called immigrants, spilling over with “milk and honey.” This narrative has shown itself to be fraud several times over the course of US history so much so that this moment fades into the background. Once again, it is the standard, not the exception.\\nWhen reflecting upon our current moment, I am reminded of those who advocate for an “open dialogue” during the speaker events held on college campuses throughout the US. How such a misreading of “democracy” wages that if reasonable people would only challenge or push back against menacing, vulgar, ignorant, and bigoted speakers, opinions, thoughts, and beliefs would change. I have long inveighed against this logic as ill-thought out and reductive of the incredible amount of emotional, mental, and sometimes physical labour required to “push back” against forces who would ultimately dismiss or deny you the very substance of your existence. Charlottesville is an example of a speaker event wherein those who hate are given a podium, a soapbox, a microphone, a world stage. They are animated by the press and the hundreds of speakers, ones like Ben Shapiro who rejected the Black Lives Matter movement at UNC-Chapel Hill in the fall of 2015, who are given a crowd and despite every effort to disrupt and cancel, are still promised a platform to speak! The above quote comes from Sheryl Gay Stolberg, domestic affairs correspondent for The New York Times. Stolberg, reporting from Charlottesville, claims to have been “surprised” by the high attendance of white “millennial men” at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville. However, this is less of a shock when we think about how it is mostly white men (of varying philosophical and political backgrounds) who FILL the lecture halls of these rancid speaker events. We need heightened scrutiny and added complexity to these dialogues.\\nCurrently, the overwhelming white left is in a bind. It must confront several things including, but not limited to: its elitism, its leaders, its capital, its neoliberalism, its general phobia of black life, and so on. It has deemed its cousins, nephews, uncles, and other uncouth, unlearned individuals as the perpetrators and limits of racism. It looks at snide comments made during Thanksgiving and holiday dinners, lewd remarks about black people, supporting anti-black media and a breadth of other examples. However, this liberalism refuses to engage with upper management at their jobs, it refuses to call out business like Uber, Facebook, Twitter, and Google for their piss-poor diversity, and their high barriers to entry that only intensifies the cycle of black exclusion.\\nIf we are not willing to call in our networks and organizations that deny entrance to black people, then who do we purport to be helping? If your non-profit, NGO, or left-leaning organizations hires mainly white people, and you know which ones I am talking about, then I assume that your client base is also predominately white and that your policy of inclusiveness and diversity is lip-service. How this enigma manifests into a Charlottesville is that when we refuse to push ourselves toward diversity and inclusivity, then we fall back on staid anti-black fears and formations. When we refuse to let black folks in, we fuel racial animus ten-fold.\\nWhile it was never expected that our nation’s president, Donald Tr*mp, would be able to construct the language for condemning the rally in Charlottesville — I’ll suggest that he capitulated in order to encourage his absurd base in hopes of gaining their support in the 2020 election cycle — his lacklustre response emboldens white supremacists in two ways. First, it suggests that their actions, while done in poor taste, are not unsolicited, and by invoking the phrase “on many sides” Tr*mp green lights more antagonism toward those in solidarity against white supremacy. They are construed as violent miscreants who refuse to listen to the “other side.” We should recognize this rhetoric as a tactic to dismiss or downplay legitimate concerns rather than an actual criticism. A second example of a shallow response comes from a Republican legislator from the midwest who skirts around the issue stating on Twitter that he is, “Praying for the victims &amp; their families from the tragedy in Charlottesville.” He is not specific to who are the victims, what is tragic, or to which families he holds himself accountable. He ends by saying that he is “thankful for our law enforcement across the country.” The very law enforcement that disappears and kills black people. Such non-responses to white supremacist violence elucidates the anti-black value system I have already mentioned. It is juxtaposed next to a chorus of responses issued by Democrats (and a handful of Republicans) condemning “hate and violence in the strongest possible terms.” These statements, however, which are widely available across the Internet, point to the fallibility of an anti-black government to address anti-blackness. Duh! Although on paper it appears that our Liberal leaders are competent to deal with this moment, in actuality their track records and more specifially their voting records prove otherwise. What I am most concerned with is what will be done in the following weeks, months, and years to address systemic anti-black racism in this country. Where it will happen–in our courts, homes, schools, churches, libraries, workplaces, etc. –will matter, too. The question to grapple with is how do we rethink America outside of whiteness and its fraternal twin, anti-blackness?\\nFinally, I want to show appreciation toward those who are putting their bodies on the front lines in this fight against fascism, white supremacy, and bigotry. Those who advocate for the abolition of police, the elimination of borders and walls, the eradication of the prison-industrial complex, and other machines and technologies of death-making. I am not in Charlottesville. Neither at this point in time can I nor do I want to be. What I want is not for those who articulate this conflict every day to stand against white supremacist violence, but for white people in positions of authority, power, prominence, and high regard to push back against this show of hate. What if at the speaker event it was not those whose identities were being attacked who had to speak up and out against the slew of hate, but those who are constantly protected by institutions and wealth and privilege who took to task these terrorists.\\nSolidarity is borne out of from sacrifice. To those who make such a sacrifice as to put their well-being on the line, you are thanked. To those who challenge authority, in the face of authority, you are appreciated. But to those who are sitting at home, having voted for the current president, who could care none about the events taking place– you are not my ally and have never been a friend of mine. If this is not your fight, we have nothing more to discuss.</td>\n",

       "      <td>“I’m not ‘White’, I am Latina”- On the Insulting Rhetoric of White Latinos Invading Afro-Indigenous Spaces, September 4th, 2021\\nWritten by Victoria Kabeya, VKY\\nAll Rights Reserved\\nOriginal story here\\nAmerican institutions always had, and this is no secret, a great disdain for the individuals they made minorities in terms of economic power. If African-Americans have been throughout the centuries forced to distance themselves from their African roots which were taken away from them, and were obliged to create new identities based on their skin color as a substitute for a lack of lineages which should have linked them back to Africa, the racist, colonial creation of the term “Latino/a” or “Hispanic”, to refer to an individual with roots in South America, the Caribbean and Central America did allow many colonial Creole people from that mentioned area to exploit the racial confusion.\\nIt is not new and not a secret at all. Since 1492, with the expulsion of the black Moors from Southern Europe, a form of racism opposing Northern European whiteness to Southern European whiteness saw the light. The first ones are those whose whiteness is deemed “pure” and authentic”, while the other ones, due to the race mixing of the Moors who remained there for eight hundred years, are considered not to be really white. Their skin is darker, their hair and features more different than that of the Northeners. Following this scheme, supported by a dynamic of economic force, the center of European financial power being located in the North, Iberia being poor after having lost most of their colonies, the South remains a space of disdain from the Northerners.\\nIn reality, the racial hierarchy imposed by Europeans in the Americas and Africa was first created in Europe itself.\\nAs the Iberian colonizers created racial structures and supported the myth of mestizaje, their descendants have been living upon this narrative to either dissimulate their colonial agenda or assert their white domination. The race-mixing propaganda actually furthered confusion in the minds of the oppressed who no longer know who they truly are and want to use the Iberian identity as their foundation.\\nAs the discussion of Afro-Indigenous pride is becoming more and more present, especially with social media, White Latinos want to be included in African and Native spaces. This desire refers to the hypocrisy of the Latin colonial agent. Unlike the Northern Europeans who focus on racial separation, the white Latins use racial confusion and their flirt with non-whiteness to navigate through colors, all the while using the propaganda of mestizaje, métissage, mestiçagemto justify a colorless, rainbow-like foundations which are, according to them, the core of Latin identity. Therefore, Latinidad is not only a desire of the Criollos to impose their colonial views within the spaces of Afro-Indigenous people, but it is a colonial structure which allows one to glorify and secure the position of the Criollo/White Latino dominant figure. The latter uses the factor of race-mixing, multiracialism as a positive element when in reality, such racial blends were the consequences of rape, abuse and destruction. Yet, such multiheritages, supported by the Afro-Indigenous cultural creations now known as salsa, merengue, bachata and many other genres have been exploited as a way to showcase the joyful nature of the colonized individuals. Latinidad, thus, is the ultimate argument which validates their pro-European views.\\nIn their legendary hypocrisy, and their ultimate disdain for things not related to race-mixing, Southern Europeans and their Creole descendants are as brutal, racist and are great supporters of apartheid as well as their Northerner counterparts. Since the expulsion of the Moors, white Spaniards and Portuguese have been obsessed with whiteness, purity, Christianity and were always, therefore, as Eurocentric as the Northerners. By the 15th century, the Iberians already made a difference between Criollos and Iberians. Though they were white, one category was born and raised in the Americas (Creoles/Criollos) and was deemed lower than that of the Iberians who remained on the continent.\\nMany modern day activists complain about the lack of representation of African and Native bodies in magazines and Hispanic papers. In reality, these activists fail to understand that, there is no reason for these companies to highlight African and Native bodies when their structures were made to highlight LATINIDAD, hence individuals with Iberian roots, emulating Iberian culture and thus whiteness, Europeanness, not Nativity or Africanness. However, most modern day Latinized Afro-Indigenous people wrongly believe they are “Latinos”, almost finding a connection to Iberia as they consider and acknowledge whiteness before that of the Natives or Africans. If Latino refers to Southern Europeans, which is the case, there is no reason to ask for more Native and African inclusion at all. This is not the place of the latter two.\\nIn that issue, as they keep playing with confusion, though they are aware of the colonial legacy, they want to use the presence of African and Native bodies to justify their presence in a sphere which was made multiracial by force. As Latinidad was a concept created by both Iberian colonizers and Northern Europeans, the term serves as a symbol of distance between the Northerners in their disdain for the Southerners. Elements considered foreign to their Northern European concept of whiteness will be deemed exotic and different, even though white too\\nThe Criollos lie and want to place themselves under the domination of the Northerners, as if their position was similar to that of the African and Native bodies. Indeed, the exploitation of the Latinidad concept is made to change the narrative of oppression. The Latinos want to use the concept of “pure whiteness”, and the contempt experienced at the hands of the Northerners to claim a form of “otherness” when they, themselves, are white, colonizers and dominant entities. The Northerners do reject them whenever the dynamic of power and economic domination is at stake, but not when it comes to colonialism and domination.\\nWorst, when facing Africans in Latinized America, many white Criollos do not hesitate to claim distant Moorish so as not to be fully white to the eyes of the Africans, when they are white.\\nLatinos, Criollos, Southern Europeans were not, are not and will forever be European agents of domination and the concept of Latinidad, unfortunately, due to the complex of inferiority of the oppressed ones, the propaganda of mestizaje still allows them to give themselves a color out of opportunism.\\nAll Rights Reserved\\nVKY</td>\n",

ever!\\nThe president and Republican Party have embraced white supremacy! White supremacists foster hate speech, not free speech and as such do not have a platform to speak based on the founding principles of America.\\nThe president is a white supremacist and even Paul Ryan said so when he stated that when Trump stated a Hispanic descendant judge (born in Indiana!) could not do his job because he was Mexican and we are building a wall between the US and Mexico defines racism. I would go further and say that calling an American citizen a Mexican because his name and skin color is also racist.\\nA black protestor was beaten at one of his campaign rallies for having a poster that stated “Black lives matter” and Trump’s response was “maybe he should have been ruffed up.” This has happened to hispanics as well during the campaign and now several dark skinned people have been killed in Kansas City and Seattle because they don’t belong in America. These were American citizens killed because of their skin color by crazy white supremacists and Trump has not blinked an eye. A statistical analyst company found that in 2015, 30% of the retweets done by Trump were from white supremacist origins! This is why the white supremacist leaders think of Trump as one of them, because he is!\\nEvery white supremacist leader has voiced that Trump is one of us and rallied their people to his defense in the real world and online. These people think that because someone has a white dick they are superior to everyone else. I am sorry, but neither the dick genes nor white skin pigment ones are linked to intelligence, dedication, effort, talent, etc.. So, the data says these people are wrong and by desiring inequality defines anti-American values.\\nThis anti-American faction is united and a major force within the Republican Party, led by our very president. The discrimination, hatred, and inequality the Republican Party is accepting is the biggest domestic threat to American values ever because of the power galvanized and being wielded against equality.\\nI take this personally as many Americans should! My great grandparents immigrated from Ireland. I don’t know if they came legally or not. During the Irish potato famine many immigrants came here from Ireland because it was that or starve for many of them. They were literally and metaphorically hungrier than the people already here and would work harder for less wages and like today hated for the thought that they were taking jobs away from Americans. Bullshit! This was and is fear based discrimination and anti-American!\\nAmerica is about favoring those willing and able to be smarter and work harder! That is why we have the best most innovative companies, universities, and workers in the world! Depriving an immigrant or girl, or dark skinned person or anyone of having a fair shake to see what they can do and whether they can succeed better than others is what the American dream is about. White supremacists and now the Republican Party are spinning marketing messages to hide that plain, simple truth.   \n",

       "2892  CommUNITY to end Bigotry\\nThe increasing and recent attacks against Jews are deplorable. My thought, prayers, and actions are with my Jewish brothers and sisters.\\nSystemic injustice, structural racism, threats for existing, and violence from law enforcement against Black/Brown people are disgraceful. The missing and murdered Indigenous women and the inhumane treatment of people at the southern US border are shameful. The Islamophobia, targeting, and oppression of Muslims are lamentable.\\nNo human life is greater or more valuable than the next and we should condemn all forms of hate and protect humanity. Our lives are all interconnected whether we are conscious of it or not, what impacts one, impacts us all at varying degrees.\\nWe must understand that our freedom as Jewish people are inextricably tied to the liberty, justice, and equity of other humans. In order to combat anti-Semitism, we must first do the following internal and inter-community work:\\n1) Our Jewish community is very diverse. We must embrace and respect the various levels of Torah observances within our community. We must stand by Hasidic Jews and also be in solidarity with Reform Jews. We must accept all Jewish sects and love another without condition.\\n2) We must examine ourselves and our community. We must truly live our Jewish values and DO Jewish. We must have compassion, empathy, and care for our fellow Jew who may be in need. We must care for our home and community, first, in order to be a strong united team to fight hate together.\\n3) We must eradicate the segregation / exclusion, anti-Blackness, and antiSemitism within our own community. We must understand how we may be unconsciously biased, and how we participate in and benefit from racism and oppression. Diversity is our strength and as our Jewish community continues to become more racially diverse, we must include racial and gender representation. Diversity should be reflected throughout our community and in our organizations. Black, Asian, Mizrahi, Indigenous, and Latinx Jews should be leaders of organizations, serving on Boards of Directors, and managing programs. They should not be discriminated or retaliated against, muted, or ostracized for holding the mirror to our community, instead they should be embraced and invited to participate in the transformation that is needed to make our community more inclusive and equitable for all Jews. In order to create more harmony in our own community, we must balance and distribute the power and influence to other non-White Jews. We must evolve our community to embrace diversity and we must all personally do the work to be better mensches. When we change… the system changes. When individuals DO better, racism, bigotry, and hate are eradicated.\\nWe need to address our inter-community issues first, then we can be a stronger team to address antiSemitism and racism externally. It is imperative to accept and celebrate the diversity in the Jewish community, because when everyone feels apart of the commUNITY, respect, trust, and solidarity flourishes. It is also critical to our very existence to stand together as one, not divided in religious sects, colors, races, genders, lifestyles, incomes, etc., but united as a diverse community holding one another with love.\\nAs we continue to self reflect and do what we can to protect our lives, we must also start to do the work to abolish racism AND antiSemitism. Below are a few ways we can protect our safety, freedom, and existence:\\n1) Education:\\n* Learning about other people, their history, culture, and societal issues that impact them, help to combat ignorance and biases. When we understand other people we can create a better connection to effectively partner with them and solve problems together.\\n* Self study and self help are also important to personally evolve to be an empathetic person who respects differences. Reading books to understand unconscious racism, micro-aggressions, equity, systemic racism, antiSemitism, and implicit biases all help to create awareness related to issues that impact others and possibly ourselves. We can learn how we can do better to ensure the world is a better place for all people.\\n* Educating our youth regarding diversity, equity, and inclusion is important to ensure a better future. Teaching them by example and by study is critical to their development as a leader who lives our Jewish values. The youth are watching and learning from our words, actions, and inactions. When we are complicit regarding hateful comments, gestures, and bigoted actions, we teach our youth. We must immediately address the issue and teach them to be respectful of differences. We must teach them how to be better and have open and honest dialogue with them about current events, societal issues, fragility, privilege, and white supremacy. We must monitor their exposure to media that may demonize one group of people and correct the false information that is shared that may result in hateful thoughts and actions toward others. Teaching youth to value and celebrate diversity should be consistent and embedded in the school curriculum, Sunday school lessons, religious studies, and addressed throughout spring and summer camps. Our youth must understand history, Jewish relations in US and around the world, and the experiences of other people (genocide, apartheid, Jim Crow laws, colonization, etc.). Youth should also participate in activities to expose them to different people and attend trips to explore cultures around the world. Consider reading The Global Purpose Approach to learn more about ways to engage youth in diversity and cross cultural education.\\n2) Intersectional social justice:\\nTikkun Olam and Tzedek must be intersectional. We must not only do what benefits Jews, but the lives of other non-Jews. We must support Black lives as they suffer chronic injustices and inequities. We must protest the cruelty of human life and advocate for immigrant rights, we must protect and care for our Muslim brothers and sisters oppressed and persecuted all around the world. We must stand in solidarity with other communities and work with them to improve their circumstances. When we support other issues that do not directly impact us, we build commUNITY with others. We create stronger human relations that reduce ignorance, intolerance, and bigotry.\\n3) Legislation\\nWe must support ordinances, policies, and laws (local, state, & federal) that protect the rights of humans. We must advocate for hate crimes bill and ending mass incarceration. We must be conscious of fighting for laws that protect our community, without putting other people’s human and civil rights at risk. We must not only support laws that benefit us, but support laws that can help improve the lives of people different from us (immigration, reparations, gentrification, equitable education, etc.).\\n4) Representation & Inclusion:\\nWe must ensure diversity inclusion within our community and create events/programs that include other people who may be different from us. When we create open community wide events embracing non-Jews, we should ensure representation from various races, cultures, and religions (not only Muslims and Christians, but Buddhists, Sikhs, Hindus, etc.). Working with Asian, Black, Latinx, Indigenous, LGBTQIAP, Mizrahi, Israelis, Palestinians, and disabled people is important to create a bridge for better understanding and teamwork. We demonstrate respect for others as we work through the conflicts that may arise and as we consciously explore commUNITY together. We should also engage diversity in the planning, programming, and promotions of open community-wide events. We should understand the similarities between various religious holidays/celebrations and consider joint events to celebrate our diversity. We should have engagements that foster brave conversations to build awareness and empathy. Working on joint projects, initiatives, legislation, and doing community service together will also create strong bonds connecting our communities and reducing the fear that breeds hate.\\n5) Black and Jewish relations:\\nJewish and Black communities have a long history of collaboration especially during the Civil Rights Movement. This history serves as a good foundation for how we should work together today on issues impacting both communities. We should understand the context of the historical tension between Blacks and Jews and study the current day impact. Many Blacks believe they are hated by non-Black Jews and some Jews are subjected to antiSemitism by Black people. We should investigate and explore the root cause of hate from both sides. We should be factual, objective, and authentic as we engage with one another to build a strong commUNITY. Transparent discussions are critical and Black Jews should be included in leading these conversations with Black people and White Jews. The conversations should result in strategic actions that ensure sustainable transformation. Black and Jewish coalitions should be revised to include the leadership of Black Jews. Jews should learn more about and support the current Black Lives Matter Movement. Jews should take actions to end structural racism that is destroying lives and the ability for Black people to equitably thrive. Black people should learn more about Jews and take actions to end antiSemitism. Swiftly condemning all acts of violence and terrorism, also demonstrate compassion and solidarity. Co-organizing, collaborating, and courageous conversations are important to reducing fear, distrust, intolerance, disrespect, and ignorance. Blacks and Jews have a shared history that intersects centuries ago. We are more connected than we may even realize, we are one in the same. It behooves us to join in the effort of eradicating bigotry that impacts us all.\\nCombating antiSemitism requires internal work within ourselves and our community first. Then it requires education, exposure, experiences, and collaboration with others. We must do all we can to protect ourselves, our families, and our community. We must also engage and seek common ground with others. We must unite to work on issues that are mutually beneficial and transformative.\\nI really hope for a better world, I hope we can all unite to fight hate and abolish all forms of bigotry. As we start the New Year 2020, may we start to take dedicated actions to make our communities stronger, safer, and more united than ever before.   \n",

Bust out your Halloween’s finest, blast a classic Halloween song and get into the spooky spirit.\\nI don’t know about you, but I love Halloween! It’s my favorite unofficial holiday, and it happens in my favorite season, fall. I love visiting pumpkin patches (also known as Vons) and picking out the biggest pumpkin in the batch. I enjoy dressing up in my best glamorous drag or as a less elaborate Mortal Kombat character. And it warms my heart as I hand out candies to five-year-old trick or treaters in adorable costumes.\\nAlthough the season is meant to be fun, spirited, we’re bound to encounter people who take it too far in the costume department. People’s lack of care and problematic racial and cultural sensibilities reveal themselves and create a mockery out of the so-called costumes they adorn. Karen will dress up with an Indigenous headdress; Chad will wear blackface, and Becky will style her hair in cornrows.\\nInevitably, and as if reading a script, the response to being called out is some variety of “it’s just a costume, what’s the big deal?” and “this is cultural appreciation.” However, there’s a difference between cultural appreciation and cultural appropriation. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, appropriation is defined as the following:\\nThere are vast examples of appropriation across the globe and especially within American society. For instance, the use of Indigenous people as football mascots is one of them. The entire British Museum collection is another, and even more highly contentious, the use of African American English Vernacular (AAVE) by non-Black people. Still, appropriation often masquerades as “appreciation” and does so with unbridled entitlement.\\nOn the other hand, appreciation is a practice that includes a mutual and beneficial exchange between two different cultures. Unfortunately, American whiteness does not have a strong track record of ethically engaging with other cultures. In fact, its historical record shows a violent past that intentionally tried to wipe out Indigenous cultures and subsumed white ethnic cultures to hoard power and privilege. How does the past influence the present? Well, whiteness has created a condition where people seemingly want to engage with bits and pieces of, say, Black culture, but without actual Black people. That’s why white people are seen as “cool” when they adopt AAVE, but Black people are criminalized for it.\\nIn a racialized society like ours, we have to be critical about how we engage with other cultures to not perpetuate white supremacy and racism. So, without further ado, here are some Halloween “costumes” to avoid, so you aren’t labeled a racist:\\nDo NOT dress up as a Black person, period. It doesn’t matter if you’re going for a beloved Black character on television. There’s a long list of people who’ve dressed up as Black people for Halloween, and they’ve all been incredibly offensive and anti-Black. In 2013, Dancing with the Stars alum Julianne Hough perpetuated racist behavior by dressing up as Crazy Eyes — a Black character on Orange Is the New Black. In addition to appropriating the Black character’s hairstyle, she darkened her skin with make-up and wore blackface.\\nAs I mentioned earlier, history matters and whiteness has a grotesque past that includes mocking Blackness and Black people. Though Hough claimed that it wasn’t her intention to offend anyone, she evoked the same white supremacy and racism that seared minstrel shows into the American legacy. Her portrayal of a Black woman was a modern-day version of the minstrelsy of yesteryear.\\nThe main objective of 20th-century minstrel shows was to intentionally ridicule Black people, including sporting blackface and over-exaggerating mannerisms. Minstrelsy was birthed out of white supremacy and racism; therefore, we cannot separate the parts that make it up from its history and claim today that there was no malintent.\\nIn my personal and humble opinion, there is no ethical way for a white person to dress up as a Black person. If we don’t understand the psychological violence of past white supremacy and racism, we will not recognize their evolved manifestations today.\\nDo NOT dress up as The Black Lives Matter (BLM) Movement. The BLM movement originates from an organization that sadly has to convince the larger population that systemic anti-Black violence is a problem. Though 2020 was a monumental year for the organization, the movement has gradually built momentum since its inception in 2015.\\nIf you want to show solidarity with BLM, there’s a myriad of ways one can do this — at the core, they all converge around organizing with BLM and its supporters. For instance, AWARE-LA is a white antiracist organization that works collectively with BLM LA. It organizes white people in the struggle against white supremacy and racism, among many other problematic systems. Dressing up as some version of BLM minimizes the hard work and efforts of Black organizers and demonstrates a performative act of solidarity.\\nChasing clout and allyship brownie points are not the way to go whether it’s Halloween season or not. If we want to support BLM, the best way to do that is through tangible action, not silly seasonal regalia.\\nDo NOT dress up as a Native/Indigenous person. All too often, Indigenous property (including offensive imitations) are used as Halloween costumes and music festival attire. It’s an incredibly insulting demonstration of contempt for what Indigenous people have suffered. Indigenous people of the Americas were violently stripped of their lands, language, and culture. They were also coerced by white settlers to live on reservations, which eerily parallel concentration camps.\\nYou’ve likely seen the white teacher secretly recorded by a student as she portrayed a stereotypical caricature of an Indigenous person. The math teacher distastefully performed a mnemonic technique to help her students remember three essential trigonometry functions: sine, cosine, and tangent. She ran around the classroom shouting “SohCahToa” and prayed to the “wind” and “rock gods.” Since the spectacle became viral, the teacher has been placed on administrative leave, and the school has issued a statement where they professed “[the math teacher’s] actions do not represent the values of our district.” Ironically and predictably, her actions have been consistent since 2012 — perhaps longer, but we may not know — and the school has tacitly supported her behavior.\\nAlthough the math teacher is a vulgar example, the offensive portrayal of Indigeneity on white bodies adds salt to an old wound. It’s uncouth to cosplay as Indigenous people and violent to mock Indigeneity, especially as white people continue to capitalize on the theft of Indigenous land.\\nThough this list is not exhaustive, it’s essential to recognize that a “cool” costume to some may be a Halloween nightmare to others. If you have doubts about this year’s outfit of choice, that’s a great place to start. I think we should have a checks and balances system when it comes to potentially offensive costumes. After all, given the racist history of whiteness, appreciation and admiration can quickly become appropriation.\\nBottom line, when in doubt, just dress up like a bunny.\\nJoey Pierre is a race & class researcher, scholar, writer, and an amateur astronomer.

Trump would actually say those things. AND use kids locked up from the border cages— if he thought he could use them to get re-elected.\\nHe has been looking dejected. He is down in the polls. He is NOT done. The man is EVIL incarnate.\\nI’m thinking the one way to fight him is through his narcissism — stop paying attention to him. Flat out ignore him. If the world started ignoring Trump — he wouldn’t exist. It is his EGO that got him where he is. He’s the reality t.v. president. All fake all the time. All promises, no follow-through. It’s all about ratings. “How are my ratings Bob? Do they still like me? That’s good, that’s good.”\\n“Oh, but you are falling in several demographics. So you are going to have to drop the White Supremacy Theme. We are taking that one out. It’s a no go for the majority of Americans. We told you it wouldn’t work. We also said authoritarianism is not a good idea in America…….”\\n“I’M THE PRESIDENT I CAN TO WHATEVER I WANT!!!!”\\n“Ok Donny. I’ll be back when you calm down. We speak in inside voices. No yelling.”\\nTreat a toddler like a toddler. The man is a super-brat, not some super genius like he claims!! Why are people so afraid of him? It’s insane!!\\n…… Ok so get someone to hack his campaign (brain, lol), change his theme to….. something other than White Supremacy, racism, authoritarianism, or the other people did it, the other people suck, or the other people are going to screw you over and you won’t have a job (the other people = Democrats, women, minorities, any one else he hates at the moment, fucking everybody other than Jews and Christians, WHITE PEOPLE, is that a coincidence?), and we are good to go!!   \n",

As much resistance and criticism that we show toward the terrorists in Charlottesville, we should also show to the propagandists who come to speak on our college campuses.\\nAfter a full day of rest, I have amassed the energy to speak on the white supremacist, anti-black violence occurring not only in Charlottesville, Va but elsewhere. The ongoing attacks upon black people, non-black people of color, immigrants, womyn, non-white queer and trans folks are indicative of a historical valuation in favor of whiteness: white children, white values, white women, white entrepreneurship, predominately white institutions, white wealth, white Whole Foods, white bread, white aesthetics, white teeth, OVER the valuation of black lives. It is infuriating, but if you have been paying attention at all in the last eight months, this moment is not exceptional. It comes as no surprise. It shocks me none. This moment represents what I already know: I am not particularly welcomed or loved in this country. A country of so-called immigrants, spilling over with “milk and honey.” This narrative has shown itself to be fraud several times over the course of US history so much so that this moment fades into the background. Once again, it is the standard, not the exception.\\nWhen reflecting upon our current moment, I am reminded of those who advocate for an “open dialogue” during the speaker events held on college campuses throughout the US. How such a misreading of “democracy” wages that if reasonable people would only challenge or push back against menacing, vulgar, ignorant, and bigoted speakers, opinions, thoughts, and beliefs would change. I have long inveighed against this logic as ill-thought out and reductive of the incredible amount of emotional, mental, and sometimes physical labour required to “push back” against forces who would ultimately dismiss or deny you the very substance of your existence. Charlottesville is an example of a speaker event wherein those who hate are given a podium, a soapbox, a microphone, a world stage. They are animated by the press and the hundreds of speakers, ones like Ben Shapiro who rejected the Black Lives Matter movement at UNC-Chapel Hill in the fall of 2015, who are given a crowd and despite every effort to disrupt and cancel, are still promised a platform to speak! The above quote comes from Sheryl Gay Stolberg, domestic affairs correspondent for The New York Times. Stolberg, reporting from Charlottesville, claims to have been “surprised” by the high attendance of white “millennial men” at the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville. However, this is less of a shock when we think about how it is mostly white men (of varying philosophical and political backgrounds) who FILL the lecture halls of these rancid speaker events. We need heightened scrutiny and added complexity to these dialogues.\\nCurrently, the overwhelming white left is in a bind. It must confront several things including, but not limited to: its elitism, its leaders, its capital, its neoliberalism, its general phobia of black life, and so on. It has deemed its cousins, nephews, uncles, and other uncouth, unlearned individuals as the perpetrators and limits of racism. It looks at snide comments made during Thanksgiving and holiday dinners, lewd remarks about black people, supporting anti-black media and a breadth of other examples. However, this liberalism refuses to engage with upper management at their jobs, it refuses to call out business like Uber, Facebook, Twitter, and Google for their piss-poor diversity, and their high barriers to entry that only intensifies the cycle of black exclusion.\\nIf we are not willing to call in our networks and organizations that deny entrance to black people, then who do we purport to be helping? If your non-profit, NGO, or left-leaning organizations hires mainly white people, and you know which ones I am talking about, then I assume that your client base is also predominately white and that your policy of inclusiveness and diversity is lip-service. How this enigma manifests into a Charlottesville is that when we refuse to push ourselves toward diversity and inclusivity, then we fall back on staid anti-black fears and formations. When we refuse to let black folks in, we fuel racial animus ten-fold.\\nWhile it was never expected that our nation’s president, Donald Tr*mp, would be able to construct the language for condemning the rally in Charlottesville — I’ll suggest that he capitulated in order to encourage his absurd base in hopes of gaining their support in the 2020 election cycle — his lacklustre response emboldens white supremacists in two ways. First, it suggests that their actions, while done in poor taste, are not unsolicited, and by invoking the phrase “on many sides” Tr*mp green lights more antagonism toward those in solidarity against white supremacy. They are construed as violent miscreants who refuse to listen to the “other side.” We should recognize this rhetoric as a tactic to dismiss or downplay legitimate concerns rather than an actual criticism. A second example of a shallow response comes from a Republican legislator from the midwest who skirts around the issue stating on Twitter that he is, “Praying for the victims & their families from the tragedy in Charlottesville.” He is not specific to who are the victims, what is tragic, or to which families he holds himself accountable. He ends by saying that he is “thankful for our law enforcement across the country.” The very law enforcement that disappears and kills black people. Such non-responses to white supremacist violence elucidates the anti-black value system I have already mentioned. It is juxtaposed next to a chorus of responses issued by Democrats (and a handful of Republicans) condemning “hate and violence in the strongest possible terms.” These statements, however, which are widely available across the Internet, point to the fallibility of an anti-black government to address anti-blackness. Duh! Although on paper it appears that our Liberal leaders are competent to deal with this moment, in actuality their track records and more specifially their voting records prove otherwise. What I am most concerned with is what will be done in the following weeks, months, and years to address systemic anti-black racism in this country. Where it will happen–in our courts, homes, schools, churches, libraries, workplaces, etc. –will matter, too. The question to grapple with is how do we rethink America outside of whiteness and its fraternal twin, anti-blackness?\\nFinally, I want to show appreciation toward those who are putting their bodies on the front lines in this fight against fascism, white supremacy, and bigotry. Those who advocate for the abolition of police, the elimination of borders and walls, the eradication of the prison-industrial complex, and other machines and technologies of death-making. I am not in Charlottesville. Neither at this point in time can I nor do I want to be. What I want is not for those who articulate this conflict every day to stand against white supremacist violence, but for white people in positions of authority, power, prominence, and high regard to push back against this show of hate. What if at the speaker event it was not those whose identities were being attacked who had to speak up and out against the slew of hate, but those who are constantly protected by institutions and wealth and privilege who took to task these terrorists.\\nSolidarity is borne out of from sacrifice. To those who make such a sacrifice as to put their well-being on the line, you are thanked. To those who challenge authority, in the face of authority, you are appreciated. But to those who are sitting at home, having voted for the current president, who could care none about the events taking place– you are not my ally and have never been a friend of mine.

If African-Americans have been throughout the centuries forced to distance themselves from their African roots which were taken away from them, and were obliged to create new identities based on their skin color as a substitute for a lack of lineages which should have linked them back to Africa, the racist, colonial creation of the term “Latino/a” or “Hispanic”, to refer to an individual with roots in South America, the Caribbean and Central America did allow many colonial Creole people from that mentioned area to exploit the racial confusion.\\nIt is not new and not a secret at all. Since 1492, with the expulsion of the black Moors from Southern Europe, a form of racism opposing Northern European whiteness to Southern European whiteness saw the light. The first ones are those whose whiteness is deemed “pure” and authentic”, while the other ones, due to the race mixing of the Moors who remained there for eight hundred years, are considered not to be really white. Their skin is darker, their hair and features more different than that of the Northeners. Following this scheme, supported by a dynamic of economic force, the center of European financial power being located in the North, Iberia being poor after having lost most of their colonies, the South remains a space of disdain from the Northerners.\\nIn reality, the racial hierarchy imposed by Europeans in the Americas and Africa was first created in Europe itself.\\nAs the Iberian colonizers created racial structures and supported the myth of mestizaje, their descendants have been living upon this narrative to either dissimulate their colonial agenda or assert their white domination. The race-mixing propaganda actually furthered confusion in the minds of the oppressed who no longer know who they truly are and want to use the Iberian identity as their foundation.\\nAs the discussion of Afro-Indigenous pride is becoming more and more present, especially with social media, White Latinos want to be included in African and Native spaces. This desire refers to the hypocrisy of the Latin colonial agent. Unlike the Northern Europeans who focus on racial separation, the white Latins use racial confusion and their flirt with non-whiteness to navigate through colors, all the while using the propaganda of mestizaje, métissage, mestiçagemto justify a colorless, rainbow-like foundations which are, according to them, the core of Latin identity. Therefore, Latinidad is not only a desire of the Criollos to impose their colonial views within the spaces of Afro-Indigenous people, but it is a colonial structure which allows one to glorify and secure the position of the Criollo/White Latino dominant figure. The latter uses the factor of race-mixing, multiracialism as a positive element when in reality, such racial blends were the consequences of rape, abuse and destruction. Yet, such multiheritages, supported by the Afro-Indigenous cultural creations now known as salsa, merengue, bachata and many other genres have been exploited as a way to showcase the joyful nature of the colonized individuals. Latinidad, thus, is the ultimate argument which validates their pro-European views.\\nIn their legendary hypocrisy, and their ultimate disdain for things not related to race-mixing, Southern Europeans and their Creole descendants are as brutal, racist and are great supporters of apartheid as well as their Northerner counterparts. Since the expulsion of the Moors, white Spaniards and Portuguese have been obsessed with whiteness, purity, Christianity and were always, therefore, as Eurocentric as the Northerners. By the 15th century, the Iberians already made a difference between Criollos and Iberians. Though they were white, one category was born and raised in the Americas (Creoles/Criollos) and was deemed lower than that of the Iberians who remained on the continent.\\nMany modern day activists complain about the lack of representation of African and Native bodies in magazines and Hispanic papers. In reality, these activists fail to understand that, there is no reason for these companies to highlight African and Native bodies when their structures were made to highlight LATINIDAD, hence individuals with Iberian roots, emulating Iberian culture and thus whiteness, Europeanness, not Nativity or Africanness. However, most modern day Latinized Afro-Indigenous people wrongly believe they are “Latinos”, almost finding a connection to Iberia as they consider and acknowledge whiteness before that of the Natives or Africans. If Latino refers to Southern Europeans, which is the case, there is no reason to ask for more Native and African inclusion at all. This is not the place of the latter two.\\nIn that issue, as they keep playing with confusion, though they are aware of the colonial legacy, they want to use the presence of African and Native bodies to justify their presence in a sphere which was made multiracial by force. As Latinidad was a concept created by both Iberian colonizers and Northern Europeans, the term serves as a symbol of distance between the Northerners in their disdain for the Southerners. Elements considered foreign to their Northern European concept of whiteness will be deemed exotic and different, even though white too\\nThe Criollos lie and want to place themselves under the domination of the Northerners, as if their position was similar to that of the African and Native bodies. Indeed, the exploitation of the Latinidad concept is made to change the narrative of oppression. The Latinos want to use the concept of “pure whiteness”, and the contempt experienced at the hands of the Northerners to claim a form of “otherness” when they, themselves, are white, colonizers and dominant entities. The Northerners do reject them whenever the dynamic of power and economic domination is at stake, but not when it comes to colonialism and domination.\\nWorst, when facing Africans in Latinized America, many white Criollos do not hesitate to claim distant Moorish so as not to be fully white to the eyes of the Africans, when they are white.\\nLatinos, Criollos, Southern Europeans were not, are not and will forever be European agents of domination and the concept of Latinidad, unfortunately, due to the complex of inferiority of the oppressed ones, the propaganda of mestizaje still allows them to give themselves a color out of opportunism.\\nAll Rights Reserved\\nVKY   \n",

That is specifically why I believe that one must also stand against the idea that the white-majority West has superior knowledge when it comes to issues like gay rights and abortion than places like Africa or Asia. Either they get the same right to decide their culture that we do or else we become white supremacists.\\nI would chose the former.   \n",

( also ! this performance was in the middle of watching grown men engage in violence for our entertainment , in a racist league that does not care about its players beating women ! ) if you were offended , disgusted or angered by the performance , i would like to ask you to take a second and ask yourself why . disgust is arm-in-arm with anger — it ’ s anger with a sense of moral superiority and/or a reaction to some kind of moral danger . with that in mind , if you were offended or disgusted , what was it about the performance that threatened your morals and why ? is that true ? how does the way you felt about the performance reflect on how you feel about your own bodies and/or women ’ s bodies ? cause i got ta tell you , if you ’ re having a strong , negative reaction to this performance , chances are you have a strong negative reaction to women in yoga pants or short skirts and if you really drill it down , you have negative feelings about the bodies of women and femmes in general . about your own body , too . and that makes sense ! we have been told we have to look a certain way for so long we believe it to be true . women &amp; femmes have been told that in order to get respect we need to have a certain type of body ( thin , white , feminine ) , dress a certain way ( mostly covered up , not too tight , feminine but also powerful ? ) in order to get respect in the workplace , in the home , on the street ( and each place seems to require a different outfit ! ) . and we have done it . we have worn power suits and “ tasteful ” skirts and starved ourselves and worn deeply uncomfortable bras and layers of makeup , and we still don ’ t get paid as much as men , we still get sexually harassed and assaulted , we still get passed up for promotions and people still have arguments about whether we are too emotional or capable of leadership . latinx and black women have been told they must contort their bodies and hair and ways of being in this world to white beauty standards and they still get paid less and hold fewer positions of power than white women . the thing is , it isn ’ t and has never been about how we present our bodies in public . it ’ s about control and power . it ’ s about our existence and the wild notion that we are also human and deserve rights and shit . and yet… we pass on the policing of bodies from generation to generation , even though it actually hasn ’ t worked for anyone to conform to white supremacist , patriarchal beauty standards . well , it works great forwhite men . by clutching our pearls at j lo and shakira we are doing their work for them . we are reinforcing our own body shame and passing it on to children and whoever else is watching . what are young women supposed to think about their bodies if we are decrying the bodies of other women ? ! instead of interrogating our thoughts about bodies and spending some very real , very uncomfortable time deconstructing what we have been taught about bodies , we just keep on keepin ’ on , passing the harm to the next generation . i have seen a lot of commentary from women about j lo and shakira objectifying themselves . that ’ s not how objectification works . the observer objectifies the observed . we turn people into objects by the way we think and talk about them . we have no idea where these remarkable women are on their journey , but to assume they were performing for the male gaze instead of being like , “ i ’ m 50 and hot af , i ’ ll wear what i want , ” is to take away their autonomy and power . i would so much rather live in a world where billie eilish doesn ’ t decide at 16 she has to wear baggy clothes so as to not be sexualized than a world where j lo has to wear sweats for us to believe she is dressing for herself . we don ’ t get to make others decisions for them , we only get to choose how we react . notice you are reacting and take a moment to reflect . how is this writing making you feel ? why ? sit with that and release it . then remember how you felt during the halftime show or some other time recently when you had a strong reaction to a persons body . muster your ability for non-judgement and compassion and ask yourself : how do you feel about the bodies you are seeing ? are those thoughts facts ? are they true ? how do these thoughts impact the way you interact with other people ? how do they impact how you feel about your own body ? what have you been taught about bodies ? about women ’ s bodies ? about the bodies of latinx women , black women , asian women ? what are you passing down to your children or the children around you ? what messages are you sending the people in your life about bodies ? that we should be ashamed of them ? that bodies have to be presented in particular ways ? that only certain bodies are acceptable ? that only parts of our bodies are okay ? that women who show parts of their bodies or move a certain way are deserving of judgement and derision ? seriously people , that is rape culture . would you have reacted the same way to a halftime show put on by a white woman ? what role did your learned beliefs about latinx women and their bodies play in your reactions to the halftime show ? what role do your internalized beliefs about black people ( black women in particular ) play into how you view black bodies ? asian bodies ? pacific islander bodies ? indigenous bodies ? are these beliefs facts ? white people hyper-sexualize black and brown and asian bodies ( i once had to sit a student of mine of asian descent down to explain to her white dudes thing with asian women and whew she was displeased ) all the time . like all the time . this has serious consequences . the hypersexualization of women of color has profound effects on educational outcomes , health outcomes , income , experiences of violence and so many other quality of life metrics . so much of the ways we objectify and sexualize is subconscious , which is why we need to pause and take the time to really notice and interrogate our reactions to other peoples bodies . doing this work is necessary if we want to live in a just world . so long as we think other bodies are less deserving of love and respect and justice , we perpetuate injustice . noticing and asking questions are the first steps to dismantling body supremacy , or as sonya renee taylor refers to it , body terrorism . she writes , “ we must not minimize or negate the impact of being told to hate or fear our bodies and the bodies of others . living in a society structured to profit from our self-hate created a dynamic in which we are so terrified of being ourselves that we adopt terror-based ways of being in our bodies . all this is fueled by a system that makes large quantities of money off our shame and bias. ” ( the body is not an apology , p. 53 ) we have been taught bodies are dirty , that they are smelly , that they need to look like a certain , specific kind of man or woman , that they need to be thin ( but not too thin ) , fit into a very narrow definition of health , fully abled and a whole host of other things . this goes double for fat bodies , triple for black and brown bodies , queer bodies , disabled bodies and goes up exponentially for every intersection at which a person find themselves . if we want to smash the patriarchy and burn down white supremacy , we need to spend time dismantling everything we have been taught about bodies . if you are interested in doing some inquiry around how your view of bodies perpetuates patriarchy , white-supremacy , ableism , and your own shame and self-doubt , go out and buy the body is not an apology by sonya renee taylor and sit with it , maybe with a friend . expand your social media feed to include bodies that make you uncomfortable — fat bodies , trans bodies , gender non conforming bodies , black bodies , latinx bodies , people wearing things in public you don ’ t think they should be wearing . challenge your thinking . and have compassion for yourself and others as you decolonize your brain . * i know a lot of trans and gender non conforming people have really complicated feelings about their bodies and i can not speak to that , but i know it is hard and complicated and am certainly not here to tell you how to feel about your body .</td>\n",
       "      <td>Upset by that halftime show? Let’s talk about how we feel about bodies. Our bodies. Women’s bodies. Black and brown bodies.\\nBodies are beautiful and worthy of love and respect and autonomy. All bodies. Full stop.\\nMy body is beautiful and worthy of love and respect and autonomy.\\nChances are you are nodding along, unaware of all the caveats your subconscious brain has for this thought. Caveats we need to examine.\\nHow we feel about other bodies is a reflection of how we feel about our own. How we feel about bodies, ours and those of others, is also a reflection of all the messages, implicit and explicit, we have received about bodies over the course of our lives*.\\nOver the past year, as a part of my healing journey (and thanks to Sonya Renee Taylor, who I will quote quite a bit), I have been intentionally noticing when I have strong reactions to life in general, and to other people’s bodies in particular. This has led me to notice how frequently a part of my brain judges people based on their body — their size, their abilities, their way of dressing, their gender presentation, their race, etc. Before I started doing this, most of these thoughts flew by, unnoticed, as a part of my mental chatter. But these thoughts are so important. They tell me a lot about how I interact with the world, messages I am giving off I am unaware of, and how much I have internalized messages about how people in general, and women, in particular, should look.\\nHow we think &amp; feel about bodies matters. Bodies are political. Bodies are policed. Bodies are jailed. Bodies are sexually assaulted. As Sonya Renee Taylor writes, “body shame and oppression are both symptoms of and tools in a far more complex and sweeping system of access and resources. A system that impacts not only how we feel about ourselves but also our opportunities and ability to thrive in the world.” (The Body is Not an Apology, 49–50)\\nWe have got to do a better job noticing how we feel and what we think about bodies — other peoples and our own — if we want to achieve justice and equity, if we truly aspire to love ourselves and others (which, as a Christian, is part of the greatest commandment, a sentiment shared by most world religions).\\nAfter the amazing show of athleticism and talent J Lo and Shakira blessed us with during the Super Bowl Halftime show, the usual suspects came out decrying the performance. I am completely unsurprised when the Christian Right comes out clutching their loincloths at women owning their bodies in a public space. What I didn’t expect was how many people (I’m lookin’ at you white women) who consider themselves feminists and racial justice advocates would be complaining about women objectifying themselves and what about the children-ing all over my social media feeds. We missed so much of the performance by getting caught up in feeling uncomfortable about their bodies! The kids in cages! J Lo singing Born in the USA draped in an amazing Puerto Rican &amp; American flag! (Also! This performance was in the middle of watching grown men engage in violence for our entertainment, in a racist league that does not care about its players beating women!)\\nIf you were offended, disgusted or angered by the performance, I would like to ask you to take a second and ask yourself why.\\nDisgust is arm-in-arm with anger — it’s anger with a sense of moral superiority and/or a reaction to some kind of moral danger.\\nWith that in mind, if you were offended or disgusted, what was it about the performance that threatened your morals and why? Is that true?\\nHow does the way you felt about the performance reflect on how you feel about your own bodies and/or women’s bodies?\\nCause I gotta tell you, if you’re having a strong, negative reaction to this performance, chances are you have a strong negative reaction to women in yoga pants or short skirts and if you really drill it down, you have negative feelings about the bodies of women and femmes in general. About your own body, too.\\nAnd that makes sense! We have been told we have to look a certain way for so long we believe it to be true. Women &amp; femmes have been told that in order to get respect we need to have a certain type of body (thin, white, feminine), dress a certain way (mostly covered up, not too tight, feminine but also powerful?) in order to get respect in the workplace, in the home, on the street (and each place seems to require a different outfit!). And we have done it. We have worn power suits and “tasteful” skirts and starved ourselves and worn deeply uncomfortable bras and layers of makeup, and we STILL don’t get paid as much as men, we STILL get sexually harassed and assaulted, we still get passed up for promotions and people still have arguments about whether we are too emotional or capable of leadership. Latinx and Black women have been told they must contort their bodies and hair and ways of being in this world to white beauty standards and they still get paid less and hold fewer positions of power than white women.\\nThe thing is, it isn’t and has never been about how we present our bodies in public. It’s about control and power. It’s about our existence and the wild notion that we are also human and deserve rights and shit. And yet… we pass on the policing of bodies from generation to generation, even though it actually hasn’t worked for anyone to conform to white supremacist, patriarchal beauty standards. Well, it works great forwhite men. By clutching our pearls at J Lo and Shakira we are doing their work for them. We are reinforcing our own body shame and passing it on to children and whoever else is watching. What are young women supposed to think about their bodies if we are decrying the bodies of other women?! Instead of interrogating our thoughts about bodies and spending some very real, very uncomfortable time deconstructing what we have been taught about bodies, we just keep on keepin’ on, passing the harm to the next generation.\\nI have seen a lot of commentary from women about J Lo and Shakira objectifying themselves. That’s not how objectification works. The observer objectifies the observed. We turn people into objects by the way we think and talk about them. We have no idea where these remarkable women are on their journey, but to assume they were performing for the male gaze instead of being like, “I’m 50 and hot AF, I’ll wear what I want,” is to take away their autonomy and power. I would so much rather live in a world where Billie Eilish doesn’t decide at 16 she has to wear baggy clothes so as to not be sexualized than a world where J Lo has to wear sweats for us to believe she is dressing for herself. We don’t get to make others decisions for them, we only get to choose how we react.\\nNotice you are reacting and take a moment to reflect.\\nHow is this writing making you feel? Why? Sit with that and release it.\\nThen remember how you felt during the halftime show or some other time recently when you had a strong reaction to a persons body. Muster your ability for non-judgement and compassion and ask yourself:\\nHow do you feel about the bodies you are seeing?\\nAre those thoughts facts? Are they true?\\nHow do these thoughts impact the way you interact with other people?\\nHow do they impact how you feel about your own body?\\nWhat have you been taught about bodies? About women’s bodies? About the bodies of Latinx women, Black women, Asian women?\\nWhat are you passing down to your children or the children around you?\\nWhat messages are you sending the people in your life about bodies? That we should be ashamed of them? That bodies have to be presented in particular ways? That only certain bodies are acceptable? That only parts of our bodies are okay? That women who show parts of their bodies or move a certain way are deserving of judgement and derision? Seriously people, THAT IS RAPE CULTURE.\\nWould you have reacted the same way to a halftime show put on by a white woman?\\nWhat role did your learned beliefs about Latinx women and their bodies play in your reactions to the halftime show?\\nWhat role do your internalized beliefs about Black people (black women in particular) play into how you view Black bodies? Asian bodies? Pacific Islander bodies? Indigenous bodies? Are these beliefs facts?\\nWhite people hyper-sexualize Black and Brown and Asian bodies (I once had to sit a student of mine of Asian descent down to explain to her white dudes thing with Asian women and WHEW she was displeased) all the time. Like all the time. This has serious consequences. The hypersexualization of women of color has profound effects on educational outcomes, health outcomes, income, experiences of violence and so many other quality of life metrics. So much of the ways we objectify and sexualize is subconscious, which is why we need to pause and take the time to really notice and interrogate our reactions to other peoples bodies.\\nDoing this work is necessary if we want to live in a just world. So long as we think other bodies are less deserving of love and respect and justice, we perpetuate injustice.\\nNoticing and asking questions are the first steps to dismantling body supremacy, or as Sonya Renee Taylor refers to it, body terrorism. She writes, “We must not minimize or negate the impact of being told to hate or fear our bodies and the bodies of others. Living in a society structured to profit from our self-hate created a dynamic in which we are so terrified of being ourselves that we adopt terror-based ways of being in our bodies. All this is fueled by a system that makes large quantities of money off our shame and bias.” (The Body is Not an Apology, p. 53)\\nWe have been taught bodies are dirty, that they are smelly, that they need to look like a certain, specific kind of man or woman, that they need to be thin (but not too thin), fit into a very narrow definition of health, fully abled and a whole host of other things. This goes double for fat bodies, triple for black and brown bodies, queer bodies, disabled bodies and goes up exponentially for every intersection at which a person find themselves. If we want to smash the patriarchy and burn down white supremacy, we need to spend time dismantling everything we have been taught about bodies.\\nIf you are interested in doing some inquiry around how your view of bodies perpetuates patriarchy, white-supremacy, ableism, and your own shame and self-doubt, go out and buy The Body is Not an Apology by Sonya Renee Taylor and sit with it, maybe with a friend. Expand your social media feed to include bodies that make you uncomfortable — fat bodies, trans bodies, gender non conforming bodies, black bodies, Latinx bodies, people wearing things in public you don’t think they should be wearing. Challenge your thinking. And have compassion for yourself and others as you decolonize your brain.\\n*I know a lot of trans and gender non conforming people have really complicated feelings about their bodies and I cannot speak to that, but I know it is hard and complicated and am certainly not here to tell you how to feel about your body.</td>\n",

       "      <td>America is the South\\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, you can stroll down cobblestone streets, admiring pastel rainbows of stately Georgian row houses and Neo-Gothic churches. You can lounge on wide wooden swings in the sunshine, listening to the waters of the Charleston Harbor lap gently against a 17th century pier. You can sit in three hundred year-old brick buildings eating two hundred dollar dinners that transform grits, rice, and pork fat into high art. You can pour yourself a night cap of fine old bourbon from an antique crystal decanter, and you can collapse, plump and satisfied, into an ornate four poster bed of burnished mahogany restored to its original, antebellum luster.\\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, you can do all of these things, but you cannot forget why, or how. Who built those beautiful row houses and glorious churches? Who laid those old bricks and passed down those old recipes? Where did all the money for the building materials come from? Who labored so others could lounge on swings in the sunshine? What, exactly, did they sell in that old market?\\nThings aren’t all as nice as they seem in Charleston, South Carolina, and no matter where you go, it’s hard not to see it.\\nIn downtown’s Marion Square, you’ll find six acres of open green space, more beautiful old buildings, and a humble Holocaust Memorial decrying Nazi Germany’s “perverse racial theory” that deemed the German Aryan Race superior to all others. Steps away — literally, just a few steps to the right of the Holocaust Memorial — you’ll find a 115-foot-tall monument to John C. Calhoun, our nation’s 7th Vice President, and one of its foremost advocates for enslaving black people. In February of 1837, he said, “where two races of different origin, and distinguished by color, and other physical differences, as well as intellectual, are brought together, the relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two, is, instead of an evil, a good–a positive good.”\\nThis man, John C. Calhoun, who led the pro-slavery faction in the Senate, whose beliefs and warnings heavily influenced the South’s secession from the Union, who spoke passionately and regularly in defense of white supremacy, is memorialized, triumphant stance cast in bronze, high atop a giant pillar, overlooking a major Charleston thoroughfare that bears his name, casting long shadows across a lonely, discarded burial shawl that was placed there in part to remind us of the death and horror and misery of racism.\\nThis is Charleston. This is the South. This is America.\\nThere’s beauty there — almost unspeakable beauty everywhere you turn. It can be exceedingly pleasant. You can live like a king, fat and happy and lazy, gratified by everything you see and touch and taste. But it’s built — all of it — on suffering. It was only ever possible because people endured so much unspeakable pain. The reminders are as constant as the summer showers, as heavy and oppressive as the heat. Everything you see is a reminder, and there’s no escaping it. Nor should there be.\\nI love returning to the South because it is beautiful, because its people are warm and kind, and because its food is literally perfect. But I also love returning to be reminded, because I need to be, because it’s no good living in a delusion, even if it is a whole lot easier.\\nWhen I come back to my home in Portland, Oregon, the reminders are less prevalent, and I start to forget, because I’m white, and I can. I wish I couldn’t, because the realities are no less real, even if the fingerprints are less visible. America is still the South. The legacy of white supremacy, of families ripped apart, of a whole race of people enslaved, persists. It’s still the root of our wealth and our power, the reason we have nice things.\\nWhen I remember, I’m better. I’m more inclined toward empathy, generosity, and gratitude. I shouldn’t need physical structures to remind me; the comparative comfort and ease of my life should really be more than enough. But I’m grateful for them. Every reminder helps.</td>\n",

       "      <td>The First Days of School | Part 1\\nWell, it’s the beginning of the school year and my Facebook feed is flooded with posts about one topic: white supremacy — what is it?/why is it?/who does it?/how to fight it?/etc. After the incident in Charlottesville, educators, in particular, are hungry to talk about it with students. Activism via social media has exploded. I’ve seen lots of righteous indignation and courageous calls to action. I’ve seen critical questions and commitments to call in/call out racism. I’ve seen marvelous methodologies and lesson models exchanged. I’ve seen a lot of buzz, all of which is beautiful, but as schools go back into session, I sit with some serious concern about the direction of this energy and angst…\\nHow do we find ourselves ready to fight white supremacy and facilitate classroom conversations about white supremacist groups, when we’ve been consistently compliant with the everyday white supremacy that happens in the four walls that we occupy? We won’t say a peep to Miss &lt;Insert-Well-Intentioned-White-Teacher-Name-Here&gt; about how problematic her classroom management is, because… She means well. We don’t organize protests against the presence of police officers or ill-prepared teachers in Black schools, because at least someone is there. We don’t demand a community-controlled revision of our curriculums — or even better: decision-making power over the distribution of our tax dollars for schools — because there is too much bureaucracy, and everyone knows that educators and parents have no real control.\\nBecause… Because… Because…\\nThere is always a reason why we can’t be more indignant with the issues, institutions, and individuals closest to us, yet somehow we’ve found all the reasons to be bold in the face of white supremacist activists and “nationalists” who we don’t know? To have protests about them? To have courageous conversations with them? To center entire lesson plans and precious classroom time on them? How Sway?\\nI can hear the rebuttals now. “Jamie, people are dying. So that requires far more urgency. We must confront these bigots!” To which I’d say, “go forth and prosper,” then pat you on the back. Because I don’t believe in debate, and what I’m about to say would surely cause one…\\nPeople have ALWAYS been dying. This experiment called the United States exists because of the mass genocide of First Nation people, or did we forget that somehow? Throughout U.S. history, millions of African people who decided they were indeed human and free, were murdered for their audacity. We have at least 500 years of deaths by white supremacy in our recorded history — bodies, minds and spirits. So my instincts tell me that we need to do some internal audits and develop some drastically different tactics. Because if we’re doing the same activism of yesteryear thinking we’re about to get new results with people who’ve been pretty consistent in their perspectives and politics for like… ummm… 5 centuries…\\nI’d say maybe the insanity of the white supremacists isn’t the insanity we should be most concerned about.\\nMy goal is not to point fingers of blame. Truthfully, I know that I can do so much more in the fight for justice than I have done. (This essay, in fact, is a small item in a long list of actions toward my own accountability.) My true aim here is to push us to ask ourselves the critical question of why we are truly so bent up about “nationalists” throwing the same temper-tantrum that they’ve always thrown for at least 400 years. Classroom management 101: you don’t give attention to tantrums, because that feeds the tantrum. So why so much attention to white supremacists?\\nI have a hunch. It’s not really about them.\\nI think it’s easier for us to focus on those metaphorical hollering children, than it is for us to look at the generations of dust, dirty dishes and disorder from white supremacy that we have dismissed, contributed to, or not dealt with in our own houses. I think their activism forces us to realize that we need to do more in our activism, and that do-more conviction translated into talking about them… something tangible and easy and external to ourselves. I think we are not really angry about the boldness of their agenda, but have a deep desire for more boldness in our own.\\nMaybe I’m wrong… Maybe.\\nEither way, here’s a suggestion:\\nStart the school year talking about our own power. Not theirs.\\nWhat are your thoughts? Clap, comment, share and subscribe!</td>\n",

       "2988  upset by that halftime show ? let ’ s talk about how we feel about bodies . our bodies . women ’ s bodies . black and brown bodies . bodies are beautiful and worthy of love and respect and autonomy . all bodies . full stop . my body is beautiful and worthy of love and respect and autonomy . chances are you are nodding along , unaware of all the caveats your subconscious brain has for this thought . caveats we need to examine . how we feel about other bodies is a reflection of how we feel about our own . how we feel about bodies , ours and those of others , is also a reflection of all the messages , implicit and explicit , we have received about bodies over the course of our lives * . over the past year , as a part of my healing journey ( and thanks to sonya renee taylor , who i will quote quite a bit ) , i have been intentionally noticing when i have strong reactions to life in general , and to other people ’ s bodies in particular . this has led me to notice how frequently a part of my brain judges people based on their body — their size , their abilities , their way of dressing , their gender presentation , their race , etc . before i started doing this , most of these thoughts flew by , unnoticed , as a part of my mental chatter . but these thoughts are so important . they tell me a lot about how i interact with the world , messages i am giving off i am unaware of , and how much i have internalized messages about how people in general , and women , in particular , should look . how we think & feel about bodies matters . bodies are political . bodies are policed . bodies are jailed . bodies are sexually assaulted . as sonya renee taylor writes , “ body shame and oppression are both symptoms of and tools in a far more complex and sweeping system of access and resources . a system that impacts not only how we feel about ourselves but also our opportunities and ability to thrive in the world. ” ( the body is not an apology , 49–50 ) we have got to do a better job noticing how we feel and what we think about bodies — other peoples and our own — if we want to achieve justice and equity , if we truly aspire to love ourselves and others ( which , as a christian , is part of the greatest commandment , a sentiment shared by most world religions ) . after the amazing show of athleticism and talent j lo and shakira blessed us with during the super bowl halftime show , the usual suspects came out decrying the performance . i am completely unsurprised when the christian right comes out clutching their loincloths at women owning their bodies in a public space . what i didn ’ t expect was how many people ( i ’ m lookin ’ at you white women ) who consider themselves feminists and racial justice advocates would be complaining about women objectifying themselves and what about the children-ing all over my social media feeds . we missed so much of the performance by getting caught up in feeling uncomfortable about their bodies ! the kids in cages ! j lo singing born in the usa draped in an amazing puerto rican & american flag ! ( also ! this performance was in the middle of watching grown men engage in violence for our entertainment , in a racist league that does not care about its players beating women ! ) if you were offended , disgusted or angered by the performance , i would like to ask you to take a second and ask yourself why . disgust is arm-in-arm with anger — it ’ s anger with a sense of moral superiority and/or a reaction to some kind of moral danger . with that in mind , if you were offended or disgusted , what was it about the performance that threatened your morals and why ? is that true ? how does the way you felt about the performance reflect on how you feel about your own bodies and/or women ’ s bodies ? cause i got ta tell you , if you ’ re having a strong , negative reaction to this performance , chances are you have a strong negative reaction to women in yoga pants or short skirts and if you really drill it down , you have negative feelings about the bodies of women and femmes in general . about your own body , too . and that makes sense ! we have been told we have to look a certain way for so long we believe it to be true . women & femmes have been told that in order to get respect we need to have a certain type of body ( thin , white , feminine ) , dress a certain way ( mostly covered up , not too tight , feminine but also powerful ? ) in order to get respect in the workplace , in the home , on the street ( and each place seems to require a different outfit ! ) . and we have done it . we have worn power suits and “ tasteful ” skirts and starved ourselves and worn deeply uncomfortable bras and layers of makeup , and we still don ’ t get paid as much as men , we still get sexually harassed and assaulted , we still get passed up for promotions and people still have arguments about whether we are too emotional or capable of leadership . latinx and black women have been told they must contort their bodies and hair and ways of being in this world to white beauty standards and they still get paid less and hold fewer positions of power than white women . the thing is , it isn ’ t and has never been about how we present our bodies in public . it ’ s about control and power . it ’ s about our existence and the wild notion that we are also human and deserve rights and shit . and yet… we pass on the policing of bodies from generation to generation , even though it actually hasn ’ t worked for anyone to conform to white supremacist , patriarchal beauty standards . well , it works great forwhite men . by clutching our pearls at j lo and shakira we are doing their work for them . we are reinforcing our own body shame and passing it on to children and whoever else is watching . what are young women supposed to think about their bodies if we are decrying the bodies of other women ? ! instead of interrogating our thoughts about bodies and spending some very real , very uncomfortable time deconstructing what we have been taught about bodies , we just keep on keepin ’ on , passing the harm to the next generation . i have seen a lot of commentary from women about j lo and shakira objectifying themselves . that ’ s not how objectification works . the observer objectifies the observed . we turn people into objects by the way we think and talk about them . we have no idea where these remarkable women are on their journey , but to assume they were performing for the male gaze instead of being like , “ i ’ m 50 and hot af , i ’ ll wear what i want , ” is to take away their autonomy and power . i would so much rather live in a world where billie eilish doesn ’ t decide at 16 she has to wear baggy clothes so as to not be sexualized than a world where j lo has to wear sweats for us to believe she is dressing for herself . we don ’ t get to make others decisions for them , we only get to choose how we react . notice you are reacting and take a moment to reflect . how is this writing making you feel ? why ? sit with that and release it . then remember how you felt during the halftime show or some other time recently when you had a strong reaction to a persons body . muster your ability for non-judgement and compassion and ask yourself : how do you feel about the bodies you are seeing ? are those thoughts facts ? are they true ? how do these thoughts impact the way you interact with other people ? how do they impact how you feel about your own body ? what have you been taught about bodies ? about women ’ s bodies ? about the bodies of latinx women , black women , asian women ? what are you passing down to your children or the children around you ? what messages are you sending the people in your life about bodies ? that we should be ashamed of them ? that bodies have to be presented in particular ways ? that only certain bodies are acceptable ? that only parts of our bodies are okay ? that women who show parts of their bodies or move a certain way are deserving of judgement and derision ? seriously people , that is rape culture . would you have reacted the same way to a halftime show put on by a white woman ? what role did your learned beliefs about latinx women and their bodies play in your reactions to the halftime show ? what role do your internalized beliefs about black people ( black women in particular ) play into how you view black bodies ? asian bodies ? pacific islander bodies ? indigenous bodies ? are these beliefs facts ? white people hyper-sexualize black and brown and asian bodies ( i once had to sit a student of mine of asian descent down to explain to her white dudes thing with asian women and whew she was displeased ) all the time . like all the time . this has serious consequences . the hypersexualization of women of color has profound effects on educational outcomes , health outcomes , income , experiences of violence and so many other quality of life metrics . so much of the ways we objectify and sexualize is subconscious , which is why we need to pause and take the time to really notice and interrogate our reactions to other peoples bodies . doing this work is necessary if we want to live in a just world . so long as we think other bodies are less deserving of love and respect and justice , we perpetuate injustice . noticing and asking questions are the first steps to dismantling body supremacy , or as sonya renee taylor refers to it , body terrorism . she writes , “ we must not minimize or negate the impact of being told to hate or fear our bodies and the bodies of others . living in a society structured to profit from our self-hate created a dynamic in which we are so terrified of being ourselves that we adopt terror-based ways of being in our bodies . all this is fueled by a system that makes large quantities of money off our shame and bias. ” ( the body is not an apology , p. 53 ) we have been taught bodies are dirty , that they are smelly , that they need to look like a certain , specific kind of man or woman , that they need to be thin ( but not too thin ) , fit into a very narrow definition of health , fully abled and a whole host of other things . this goes double for fat bodies , triple for black and brown bodies , queer bodies , disabled bodies and goes up exponentially for every intersection at which a person find themselves . if we want to smash the patriarchy and burn down white supremacy , we need to spend time dismantling everything we have been taught about bodies . if you are interested in doing some inquiry around how your view of bodies perpetuates patriarchy , white-supremacy , ableism , and your own shame and self-doubt , go out and buy the body is not an apology by sonya renee taylor and sit with it , maybe with a friend . expand your social media feed to include bodies that make you uncomfortable — fat bodies , trans bodies , gender non conforming bodies , black bodies , latinx bodies , people wearing things in public you don ’ t think they should be wearing . challenge your thinking . and have compassion for yourself and others as you decolonize your brain . * i know a lot of trans and gender non conforming people have really complicated feelings about their bodies and i can not speak to that , but i know it is hard and complicated and am certainly not here to tell you how to feel about your body .   \n",

cobblestone streets , admiring pastel rainbows of stately georgian row houses and neo-gothic churches . you can lounge on wide wooden swings in the sunshine , listening to the waters of the charleston harbor lap gently against a 17th century pier . you can sit in three hundred year-old brick buildings eating two hundred dollar dinners that transform grits , rice , and pork fat into high art . you can pour yourself a night cap of fine old bourbon from an antique crystal decanter , and you can collapse , plump and satisfied , into an ornate four poster bed of burnished mahogany restored to its original , antebellum luster . in charleston , south carolina , you can do all of these things , but you can not forget why , or how . who built those beautiful row houses and glorious churches ? who laid those old bricks and passed down those old recipes ? where did all the money for the building materials come from ? who labored so others could lounge on swings in the sunshine ? what , exactly , did they sell in that old market ? things aren ’ t all as nice as they seem in charleston , south carolina , and no matter where you go , it ’ s hard not to see it . in downtown ’ s marion square , you ’ ll find six acres of open green space , more beautiful old buildings , and a humble holocaust memorial decrying nazi germany ’ s “ perverse racial theory ” that deemed the german aryan race superior to all others . steps away — literally , just a few steps to the right of the holocaust memorial — you ’ ll find a 115-foot-tall monument to john c. calhoun , our nation ’ s 7th vice president , and one of its foremost advocates for enslaving black people . in february of 1837 , he said , “ where two races of different origin , and distinguished by color , and other physical differences , as well as intellectual , are brought together , the relation now existing in the slaveholding states between the two , is , instead of an evil , a good–a positive good. ” this man , john c. calhoun , who led the pro-slavery faction in the senate , whose beliefs and warnings heavily influenced the south ’ s secession from the union , who spoke passionately and regularly in defense of white supremacy , is memorialized , triumphant stance cast in bronze , high atop a giant pillar , overlooking a major charleston thoroughfare that bears his name , casting long shadows across a lonely , discarded burial shawl that was placed there in part to remind us of the death and horror and misery of racism . this is charleston . this is the south . this is america . there ’ s beauty there — almost unspeakable beauty everywhere you turn . it can be exceedingly pleasant . you can live like a king , fat and happy and lazy , gratified by everything you see and touch and taste . but it ’ s built — all of it — on suffering . it was only ever possible because people endured so much unspeakable pain . the reminders are as constant as the summer showers , as heavy and oppressive as the heat . everything you see is a reminder , and there ’ s no escaping it . nor should there be . i love returning to the south because it is beautiful , because its people are warm and kind , and because its food is literally perfect . but i also love returning to be reminded , because i need to be , because it ’ s no good living in a delusion , even if it is a whole lot easier . when i come back to my home in portland , oregon , the reminders are less prevalent , and i start to forget , because i ’ m white , and i can . i wish i couldn ’ t , because the realities are no less real , even if the fingerprints are less visible . america is still the south . the legacy of white supremacy , of families ripped apart , of a whole race of people enslaved , persists . it ’ s still the root of our wealth and our power , the reason we have nice things . when i remember , i ’ m better . i ’ m more inclined toward empathy , generosity , and gratitude . i shouldn ’ t need physical structures to remind me ; the comparative comfort and ease of my life should really be more than enough . but i ’ m grateful for them . every reminder helps .   \n",

feed is flooded with posts about one topic : white supremacy — what is it ? /why is it ? /who does it ? /how to fight it ? /etc . after the incident in charlottesville , educators , in particular , are hungry to talk about it with students . activism via social media has exploded . i ’ ve seen lots of righteous indignation and courageous calls to action . i ’ ve seen critical questions and commitments to call in/call out racism . i ’ ve seen marvelous methodologies and lesson models exchanged . i ’ ve seen a lot of buzz , all of which is beautiful , but as schools go back into session , i sit with some serious concern about the direction of this energy and angst… how do we find ourselves ready to fight white supremacy and facilitate classroom conversations about white supremacist groups , when we ’ ve been consistently compliant with the everyday white supremacy that happens in the four walls that we occupy ? we won ’ t say a peep to miss < insert-well-intentioned-white-teacher-name-here > about how problematic her classroom management is , because… she means well . we don ’ t organize protests against the presence of police officers or ill-prepared teachers in black schools , because at least someone is there . we don ’ t demand a community-controlled revision of our curriculums — or even better : decision-making power over the distribution of our tax dollars for schools — because there is too much bureaucracy , and everyone knows that educators and parents have no real control . because… because… because… there is always a reason why we can ’ t be more indignant with the issues , institutions , and individuals closest to us , yet somehow we ’ ve found all the reasons to be bold in the face of white supremacist activists and “ nationalists ” who we don ’ t know ? to have protests about them ? to have courageous conversations with them ? to center entire lesson plans and precious classroom time on them ? how sway ? i can hear the rebuttals now . “ jamie , people are dying . so that requires far more urgency . we must confront these bigots ! ” to which i ’ d say , “ go forth and prosper , ” then pat you on the back . because i don ’ t believe in debate , and what i ’ m about to say would surely cause one… people have always been dying . this experiment called the united states exists because of the mass genocide of first nation people , or did we forget that somehow ? throughout u.s. history , millions of african people who decided they were indeed human and free , were murdered for their audacity . we have at least 500 years of deaths by white supremacy in our recorded history — bodies , minds and spirits . so my instincts tell me that we need to do some internal audits and develop some drastically different tactics . because if we ’ re doing the same activism of yesteryear thinking we ’ re about to get new results with people who ’ ve been pretty consistent in their perspectives and politics for like… ummm… 5 centuries… i ’ d say maybe the insanity of the white supremacists isn ’ t the insanity we should be most concerned about . my goal is not to point fingers of blame . truthfully , i know that i can do so much more in the fight for justice than i have done . ( this essay , in fact , is a small item in a long list of actions toward my own accountability . ) my true aim here is to push us to ask ourselves the critical question of why we are truly so bent up about “ nationalists ” throwing the same temper-tantrum that they ’ ve always thrown for at least 400 years . classroom management 101 : you don ’ t give attention to tantrums , because that feeds the tantrum . so why so much attention to white supremacists ? i have a hunch . it ’ s not really about them . i think it ’ s easier for us to focus on those metaphorical hollering children , than it is for us to look at the generations of dust , dirty dishes and disorder from white supremacy that we have dismissed , contributed to , or not dealt with in our own houses . i think their activism forces us to realize that we need to do more in our activism , and that do-more conviction translated into talking about them… something tangible and easy and external to ourselves . i think we are not really angry about the boldness of their agenda , but have a deep desire for more boldness in our own . maybe i ’ m wrong… maybe . either way , here ’ s a suggestion : start the school year talking about our own power . not theirs . what are your thoughts ? clap , comment , share and subscribe !   \n",

Black and brown bodies.\\nBodies are beautiful and worthy of love and respect and autonomy. All bodies. Full stop.\\nMy body is beautiful and worthy of love and respect and autonomy.\\nChances are you are nodding along, unaware of all the caveats your subconscious brain has for this thought. Caveats we need to examine.\\nHow we feel about other bodies is a reflection of how we feel about our own. How we feel about bodies, ours and those of others, is also a reflection of all the messages, implicit and explicit, we have received about bodies over the course of our lives*.\\nOver the past year, as a part of my healing journey (and thanks to Sonya Renee Taylor, who I will quote quite a bit), I have been intentionally noticing when I have strong reactions to life in general, and to other people’s bodies in particular. This has led me to notice how frequently a part of my brain judges people based on their body — their size, their abilities, their way of dressing, their gender presentation, their race, etc. Before I started doing this, most of these thoughts flew by, unnoticed, as a part of my mental chatter. But these thoughts are so important. They tell me a lot about how I interact with the world, messages I am giving off I am unaware of, and how much I have internalized messages about how people in general, and women, in particular, should look.\\nHow we think & feel about bodies matters. Bodies are political. Bodies are policed. Bodies are jailed. Bodies are sexually assaulted. As Sonya Renee Taylor writes, “body shame and oppression are both symptoms of and tools in a far more complex and sweeping system of access and resources. A system that impacts not only how we feel about ourselves but also our opportunities and ability to thrive in the world.” (The Body is Not an Apology, 49–50)\\nWe have got to do a better job noticing how we feel and what we think about bodies — other peoples and our own — if we want to achieve justice and equity, if we truly aspire to love ourselves and others (which, as a Christian, is part of the greatest commandment, a sentiment shared by most world religions).\\nAfter the amazing show of athleticism and talent J Lo and Shakira blessed us with during the Super Bowl Halftime show, the usual suspects came out decrying the performance. I am completely unsurprised when the Christian Right comes out clutching their loincloths at women owning their bodies in a public space. What I didn’t expect was how many people (I’m lookin’ at you white women) who consider themselves feminists and racial justice advocates would be complaining about women objectifying themselves and what about the children-ing all over my social media feeds. We missed so much of the performance by getting caught up in feeling uncomfortable about their bodies! The kids in cages! J Lo singing Born in the USA draped in an amazing Puerto Rican & American flag! (Also! This performance was in the middle of watching grown men engage in violence for our entertainment, in a racist league that does not care about its players beating women!)\\nIf you were offended, disgusted or angered by the performance, I would like to ask you to take a second and ask yourself why.\\nDisgust is arm-in-arm with anger — it’s anger with a sense of moral superiority and/or a reaction to some kind of moral danger.\\nWith that in mind, if you were offended or disgusted, what was it about the performance that threatened your morals and why? Is that true?\\nHow does the way you felt about the performance reflect on how you feel about your own bodies and/or women’s bodies?\\nCause I gotta tell you, if you’re having a strong, negative reaction to this performance, chances are you have a strong negative reaction to women in yoga pants or short skirts and if you really drill it down, you have negative feelings about the bodies of women and femmes in general. About your own body, too.\\nAnd that makes sense! We have been told we have to look a certain way for so long we believe it to be true. Women & femmes have been told that in order to get respect we need to have a certain type of body (thin, white, feminine), dress a certain way (mostly covered up, not too tight, feminine but also powerful?) in order to get respect in the workplace, in the home, on the street (and each place seems to require a different outfit!). And we have done it. We have worn power suits and “tasteful” skirts and starved ourselves and worn deeply uncomfortable bras and layers of makeup, and we STILL don’t get paid as much as men, we STILL get sexually harassed and assaulted, we still get passed up for promotions and people still have arguments about whether we are too emotional or capable of leadership. Latinx and Black women have been told they must contort their bodies and hair and ways of being in this world to white beauty standards and they still get paid less and hold fewer positions of power than white women.\\nThe thing is, it isn’t and has never been about how we present our bodies in public. It’s about control and power. It’s about our existence and the wild notion that we are also human and deserve rights and shit. And yet… we pass on the policing of bodies from generation to generation, even though it actually hasn’t worked for anyone to conform to white supremacist, patriarchal beauty standards. Well, it works great forwhite men. By clutching our pearls at J Lo and Shakira we are doing their work for them. We are reinforcing our own body shame and passing it on to children and whoever else is watching. What are young women supposed to think about their bodies if we are decrying the bodies of other women?! Instead of interrogating our thoughts about bodies and spending some very real, very uncomfortable time deconstructing what we have been taught about bodies, we just keep on keepin’ on, passing the harm to the next generation.\\nI have seen a lot of commentary from women about J Lo and Shakira objectifying themselves. That’s not how objectification works. The observer objectifies the observed. We turn people into objects by the way we think and talk about them. We have no idea where these remarkable women are on their journey, but to assume they were performing for the male gaze instead of being like, “I’m 50 and hot AF, I’ll wear what I want,” is to take away their autonomy and power. I would so much rather live in a world where Billie Eilish doesn’t decide at 16 she has to wear baggy clothes so as to not be sexualized than a world where J Lo has to wear sweats for us to believe she is dressing for herself. We don’t get to make others decisions for them, we only get to choose how we react.\\nNotice you are reacting and take a moment to reflect.\\nHow is this writing making you feel? Why? Sit with that and release it.\\nThen remember how you felt during the halftime show or some other time recently when you had a strong reaction to a persons body. Muster your ability for non-judgement and compassion and ask yourself:\\nHow do you feel about the bodies you are seeing?\\nAre those thoughts facts? Are they true?\\nHow do these thoughts impact the way you interact with other people?\\nHow do they impact how you feel about your own body?\\nWhat have you been taught about bodies? About women’s bodies? About the bodies of Latinx women, Black women, Asian women?\\nWhat are you passing down to your children or the children around you?\\nWhat messages are you sending the people in your life about bodies? That we should be ashamed of them? That bodies have to be presented in particular ways? That only certain bodies are acceptable? That only parts of our bodies are okay? That women who show parts of their bodies or move a certain way are deserving of judgement and derision? Seriously people, THAT IS RAPE CULTURE.\\nWould you have reacted the same way to a halftime show put on by a white woman?\\nWhat role did your learned beliefs about Latinx women and their bodies play in your reactions to the halftime show?\\nWhat role do your internalized beliefs about Black people (black women in particular) play into how you view Black bodies? Asian bodies? Pacific Islander bodies? Indigenous bodies? Are these beliefs facts?\\nWhite people hyper-sexualize Black and Brown and Asian bodies (I once had to sit a student of mine of Asian descent down to explain to her white dudes thing with Asian women and WHEW she was displeased) all the time. Like all the time. This has serious consequences. The hypersexualization of women of color has profound effects on educational outcomes, health outcomes, income, experiences of violence and so many other quality of life metrics. So much of the ways we objectify and sexualize is subconscious, which is why we need to pause and take the time to really notice and interrogate our reactions to other peoples bodies.\\nDoing this work is necessary if we want to live in a just world. So long as we think other bodies are less deserving of love and respect and justice, we perpetuate injustice.\\nNoticing and asking questions are the first steps to dismantling body supremacy, or as Sonya Renee Taylor refers to it, body terrorism. She writes, “We must not minimize or negate the impact of being told to hate or fear our bodies and the bodies of others. Living in a society structured to profit from our self-hate created a dynamic in which we are so terrified of being ourselves that we adopt terror-based ways of being in our bodies. All this is fueled by a system that makes large quantities of money off our shame and bias.” (The Body is Not an Apology, p. 53)\\nWe have been taught bodies are dirty, that they are smelly, that they need to look like a certain, specific kind of man or woman, that they need to be thin (but not too thin), fit into a very narrow definition of health, fully abled and a whole host of other things. This goes double for fat bodies, triple for black and brown bodies, queer bodies, disabled bodies and goes up exponentially for every intersection at which a person find themselves. If we want to smash the patriarchy and burn down white supremacy, we need to spend time dismantling everything we have been taught about bodies.\\nIf you are interested in doing some inquiry around how your view of bodies perpetuates patriarchy, white-supremacy, ableism, and your own shame and self-doubt, go out and buy The Body is Not an Apology by Sonya Renee Taylor and sit with it, maybe with a friend. Expand your social media feed to include bodies that make you uncomfortable — fat bodies, trans bodies, gender non conforming bodies, black bodies, Latinx bodies, people wearing things in public you don’t think they should be wearing. Challenge your thinking. And have compassion for yourself and others as you decolonize your brain.\\n*I know a lot of trans and gender non conforming people have really complicated feelings about their bodies and I cannot speak to that, but I know it is hard and complicated and am certainly not here to tell you how to feel about your body.  \n",

                                                                                                                                                                                                                     America is the South\\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, you can stroll down cobblestone streets, admiring pastel rainbows of stately Georgian row houses and Neo-Gothic churches. You can lounge on wide wooden swings in the sunshine, listening to the waters of the Charleston Harbor lap gently against a 17th century pier. You can sit in three hundred year-old brick buildings eating two hundred dollar dinners that transform grits, rice, and pork fat into high art. You can pour yourself a night cap of fine old bourbon from an antique crystal decanter, and you can collapse, plump and satisfied, into an ornate four poster bed of burnished mahogany restored to its original, antebellum luster.\\nIn Charleston, South Carolina, you can do all of these things, but you cannot forget why, or how. Who built those beautiful row houses and glorious churches? Who laid those old bricks and passed down those old recipes? Where did all the money for the building materials come from? Who labored so others could lounge on swings in the sunshine? What, exactly, did they sell in that old market?\\nThings aren’t all as nice as they seem in Charleston, South Carolina, and no matter where you go, it’s hard not to see it.\\nIn downtown’s Marion Square, you’ll find six acres of open green space, more beautiful old buildings, and a humble Holocaust Memorial decrying Nazi Germany’s “perverse racial theory” that deemed the German Aryan Race superior to all others. Steps away — literally, just a few steps to the right of the Holocaust Memorial — you’ll find a 115-foot-tall monument to John C. Calhoun, our nation’s 7th Vice President, and one of its foremost advocates for enslaving black people. In February of 1837, he said, “where two races of different origin, and distinguished by color, and other physical differences, as well as intellectual, are brought together, the relation now existing in the slaveholding States between the two, is, instead of an evil, a good–a positive good.”\\nThis man, John C. Calhoun, who led the pro-slavery faction in the Senate, whose beliefs and warnings heavily influenced the South’s secession from the Union, who spoke passionately and regularly in defense of white supremacy, is memorialized, triumphant stance cast in bronze, high atop a giant pillar, overlooking a major Charleston thoroughfare that bears his name, casting long shadows across a lonely, discarded burial shawl that was placed there in part to remind us of the death and horror and misery of racism.\\nThis is Charleston. This is the South. This is America.\\nThere’s beauty there — almost unspeakable beauty everywhere you turn. It can be exceedingly pleasant. You can live like a king, fat and happy and lazy, gratified by everything you see and touch and taste. But it’s built — all of it — on suffering. It was only ever possible because people endured so much unspeakable pain. The reminders are as constant as the summer showers, as heavy and oppressive as the heat. Everything you see is a reminder, and there’s no escaping it. Nor should there be.\\nI love returning to the South because it is beautiful, because its people are warm and kind, and because its food is literally perfect. But I also love returning to be reminded, because I need to be, because it’s no good living in a delusion, even if it is a whole lot easier.\\nWhen I come back to my home in Portland, Oregon, the reminders are less prevalent, and I start to forget, because I’m white, and I can. I wish I couldn’t, because the realities are no less real, even if the fingerprints are less visible. America is still the South. The legacy of white supremacy, of families ripped apart, of a whole race of people enslaved, persists. It’s still the root of our wealth and our power, the reason we have nice things.\\nWhen I remember, I’m better. I’m more inclined toward empathy, generosity, and gratitude. I shouldn’t need physical structures to remind me; the comparative comfort and ease of my life should really be more than enough. But I’m grateful for them. Every reminder helps.  \n",

First Days of School | Part 1\\nWell, it’s the beginning of the school year and my Facebook feed is flooded with posts about one topic: white supremacy — what is it?/why is it?/who does it?/how to fight it?/etc. After the incident in Charlottesville, educators, in particular, are hungry to talk about it with students. Activism via social media has exploded. I’ve seen lots of righteous indignation and courageous calls to action. I’ve seen critical questions and commitments to call in/call out racism. I’ve seen marvelous methodologies and lesson models exchanged. I’ve seen a lot of buzz, all of which is beautiful, but as schools go back into session, I sit with some serious concern about the direction of this energy and angst…\\nHow do we find ourselves ready to fight white supremacy and facilitate classroom conversations about white supremacist groups, when we’ve been consistently compliant with the everyday white supremacy that happens in the four walls that we occupy? We won’t say a peep to Miss <Insert-Well-Intentioned-White-Teacher-Name-Here> about how problematic her classroom management is, because… She means well. We don’t organize protests against the presence of police officers or ill-prepared teachers in Black schools, because at least someone is there. We don’t demand a community-controlled revision of our curriculums — or even better: decision-making power over the distribution of our tax dollars for schools — because there is too much bureaucracy, and everyone knows that educators and parents have no real control.\\nBecause… Because… Because…\\nThere is always a reason why we can’t be more indignant with the issues, institutions, and individuals closest to us, yet somehow we’ve found all the reasons to be bold in the face of white supremacist activists and “nationalists” who we don’t know? To have protests about them? To have courageous conversations with them? To center entire lesson plans and precious classroom time on them? How Sway?\\nI can hear the rebuttals now. “Jamie, people are dying. So that requires far more urgency. We must confront these bigots!” To which I’d say, “go forth and prosper,” then pat you on the back. Because I don’t believe in debate, and what I’m about to say would surely cause one…\\nPeople have ALWAYS been dying. This experiment called the United States exists because of the mass genocide of First Nation people, or did we forget that somehow? Throughout U.S. history, millions of African people who decided they were indeed human and free, were murdered for their audacity. We have at least 500 years of deaths by white supremacy in our recorded history — bodies, minds and spirits. So my instincts tell me that we need to do some internal audits and develop some drastically different tactics. Because if we’re doing the same activism of yesteryear thinking we’re about to get new results with people who’ve been pretty consistent in their perspectives and politics for like… ummm… 5 centuries…\\nI’d say maybe the insanity of the white supremacists isn’t the insanity we should be most concerned about.\\nMy goal is not to point fingers of blame. Truthfully, I know that I can do so much more in the fight for justice than I have done. (This essay, in fact, is a small item in a long list of actions toward my own accountability.) My true aim here is to push us to ask ourselves the critical question of why we are truly so bent up about “nationalists” throwing the same temper-tantrum that they’ve always thrown for at least 400 years. Classroom management 101: you don’t give attention to tantrums, because that feeds the tantrum. So why so much attention to white supremacists?\\nI have a hunch. It’s not really about them.\\nI think it’s easier for us to focus on those metaphorical hollering children, than it is for us to look at the generations of dust, dirty dishes and disorder from white supremacy that we have dismissed, contributed to, or not dealt with in our own houses. I think their activism forces us to realize that we need to do more in our activism, and that do-more conviction translated into talking about them… something tangible and easy and external to ourselves. I think we are not really angry about the boldness of their agenda, but have a deep desire for more boldness in our own.\\nMaybe I’m wrong… Maybe.\\nEither way, here’s a suggestion:\\nStart the school year talking about our own power. Not theirs.\\nWhat are your thoughts? Clap, comment, share and subscribe!  "
