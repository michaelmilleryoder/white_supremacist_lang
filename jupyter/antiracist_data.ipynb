As in, to a degree, feeling oppressed keeps you oppressed. Naturally, it would be ignorant of me to say that this feeling is baseless and purely fabricated by her imagination.  Of course racism is real, and so is racial oppression. \\n\\nI suppose that in order to really learn from this experience, I'd like to learn more about my privileges as a white person since, as you so eloquently stated, my perceptions of them often appear as normalcies, instead of the \"perks\" that they really are. I think this suspicion regarding my own lack of knowledge of personal privilege has something to do with why I left the argument feeling like I had done something wrong.</td>\n",

I don't mean to invade space, just want to share something similar. \\n\\nAbout 7 years ago my country had really big protests, lasting for almost the whole of summer. In those protests, there were a lot of people carrying our country's flag, unfortunately did not do much in terms of police brutality. The police responded by carrying flags themselves, putting flags on their cars, water cannons etc. While OP is absolutely right that it is a powerful image, there were also people on \"the other side\" (the other side is very conservative right for context) claiming things like \"how dare they drag OUR flag to THEIR protests and THEIR politics??\". Also, some protesters dropped flags on the ground while being attacked by the police, and that was used by these people and mainstream media to say \"look at them tarnishing the flag by putting it on the ground/stepping on it\" and therefore excusing police brutality even more. I'm not saying that will happen in the US, I don't know much about how the flag is viewed in your country. Just saying that they can in fact spin it very badly if they want to.\\n\\nAlso solidarity and power to you all!</td>\n",

This situation should be dealt with, and speaking with the coach sounds like a necessary measure. Speaking with the guy individually might also start a shift in his worldview, but that's a tough one and requires a very open and vulnerable position from both sides of the dialogue. True change and understanding takes time to develop. One thing is certain though: this cannot be left unaddressed, or it will escalate. I wish you courage in this predicament!</td>\n",

This is exactly what I was hoping for. \\n\\nI mentioned anarchy because I'm in interested how those of us who wish to do away with perceived social/economic/racial hierarchies view things like white privilege. \\n\\nIn response to your question, \"How did her post perpetuate racial oppression?\" I just... i suspect that her acting entitled to being mad at white people because shes black is the sort of thing that probably keeps her oppressed. As in, to a degree, feeling oppressed keeps you oppressed. Naturally, it would be ignorant of me to say that this feeling is baseless and purely fabricated by her imagination.  Of course racism is real, and so is racial oppression. \\n\\nI suppose that in order to really learn from this experience, I'd like to learn more about my privileges as a white person since, as you so eloquently stated, my perceptions of them often appear as normalcies, instead of the \"perks\" that they really are. I think this suspicion regarding my own lack of knowledge of personal privilege has something to do with why I left the argument feeling like I had done something wrong.  \n",

       "34840  Hiya, I'm not black so if it is out of line to speak here, I'm sorry. Feel free to remove my comment. I don't mean to invade space, just want to share something similar. \\n\\nAbout 7 years ago my country had really big protests, lasting for almost the whole of summer. In those protests, there were a lot of people carrying our country's flag, unfortunately did not do much in terms of police brutality. The police responded by carrying flags themselves, putting flags on their cars, water cannons etc. While OP is absolutely right that it is a powerful image, there were also people on \"the other side\" (the other side is very conservative right for context) claiming things like \"how dare they drag OUR flag to THEIR protests and THEIR politics??\". Also, some protesters dropped flags on the ground while being attacked by the police, and that was used by these people and mainstream media to say \"look at them tarnishing the flag by putting it on the ground/stepping on it\" and therefore excusing police brutality even more. I'm not saying that will happen in the US, I don't know much about how the flag is viewed in your country. Just saying that they can in fact spin it very badly if they want to.\\n\\nAlso solidarity and power to you all!  \n",

The host never even pushed back and called bullshit on it, even though it was NEVER EVER claimed that Tamir Rice was doing anything but playing in a park with his toy gun.  \n",

Your teammate sounds like a true and proud racist, not hiding his views and being easily triggered. This situation should be dealt with, and speaking with the coach sounds like a necessary measure. Speaking with the guy individually might also start a shift in his worldview, but that's a tough one and requires a very open and vulnerable position from both sides of the dialogue. True change and understanding takes time to develop. One thing is certain though: this cannot be left unaddressed, or it will escalate. I wish you courage in this predicament!  \n",

My wife overheard another mom at baseball practice talking about a Mexican man they had to do contracting work with at their house.  She made sure to emphasize his ethnicity and stress how worried she was he was going to steal. Small white town in the south.  \n",

       "2        Thank you, thank you, thank you. \\n\\nRon Paul represents an evolving social/political consciousness. I don't think the country as a whole (or should I say as a hole) is willing to make that leap just yet, but Ron is representing the sentiment of a large demographic  who are sick of the corruption currently being lived through. The corruption, of course, isn't solely caused by the ones on top. The ones truly to blame are the populace as a whole who won't stand up to unjust behavior. Hence the importance of Ron: he's the only one expressing a sentiment that is needed for the country to evolve into something new and better.\\n\\nHe's no savior. He's just the one with the balls to say what needs to be said. Thank God. He may not become president, but he's changing people's minds for the better.    \n",

       "2        Thank you, thank you, thank you. \\n\\nRon Paul represents an evolving social/political consciousness. I don't think the country as a whole (or should I say as a hole) is willing to make that leap just yet, but Ron is representing the sentiment of a large demographic  who are sick of the corruption currently being lived through. The corruption, of course, isn't solely caused by the ones on top. The ones truly to blame are the populace as a whole who won't stand up to unjust behavior. Hence the importance of Ron: he's the only one expressing a sentiment that is needed for the country to evolve into something new and better.\\n\\nHe's no savior. He's just the one with the balls to say what needs to be said. Thank God. He may not become president, but he's changing people's minds for the better.    \n",

My cousin is doing neuro biology research at a top California university and nearly all of her program's funding comes a pharmacy company.

While they don't focus on terrorism and there has always a veneer of good vs evil and redemption,   the redemptions comes via morally ambiguous mass killings. I'm not arguing that GTA is breeding serial killers or anything like it, just that the subject matter of these games is as perverse and anti social as the subject matter on Fox News. \n",

       "46187  there are a lot of other factors that affect the cost as well. If your wife has a relatively rare bone marrow disease, a the costs will be a lot higher than a mass produced drug. The company still needs to run the same safety tests and there are a lot of other inefficiencies in small scale production. Your wife's drug could also be difficult to produce compared to other medicines. Even if the research was conducted by universities, a lot of the money could of come from drug companies. My cousin is doing neuro biology research at a top California university and nearly all of her program's funding comes a pharmacy company. This might not be the case for your wife's drug, but Big Pharma often hires universities to do a lot of its research. But the drug company also needs to make up for all the money it lost on research on other drugs that it failed to bring to market. It sucks for your family, but this could also be a factor for your wife's drug\n",
