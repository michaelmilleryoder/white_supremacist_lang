Plus cooking can be a fun family activity if you make it so.  Making huge amounts and freezing also cuts time in about half for most foods. You do have a point though, as 95% of the time I get fast food it's a quick/convenience thing.   \n",
       "6229   What if individual executives here held more directly liable for the content of the speech they approve?  This would seem to be the reason that journalists want a federal shield law, and why Judith Miller went to jail.\\n\\n\\nCorporate liability shields individuals who authorize illegal and immoral acts.\\n\\n\\nConsider the EU Microsoft Anti-Competition Case: Microsoft was fined $2 billion for operating in open violation of the law for over a decade.  Because nobody went to jail, executives had no incentive to obey the law.  Legal fees become simply another business expense, perhaps cheaper in the long run than marketing and advertising.\\n\\n\\nWe saw something similar with the retroactive immunity for telecommunications carriers that spied on us citizens (where, incidentally, Verizon justified handing over customer data to the National Security Agency as protected free speech).   \n",

All I'm trying to tell you is that you need to provide something more than some lawyer's interpretation of the passage and your opinion in the matter in order to claim that other people are misinterpreting the passage since they are not evidences or facts. Or else you are just making a baseless claim and it would not be surprising that people don't agree with you.\n",

While they don't focus on terrorism and there has always a veneer of good vs evil and redemption,   the redemptions comes via morally ambiguous mass killings. I'm not arguing that GTA is breeding serial killers or anything like it, just that the subject matter of these games is as perverse and anti social as the subject matter on Fox News. \n",

       "46187  there are a lot of other factors that affect the cost as well. If your wife has a relatively rare bone marrow disease, a the costs will be a lot higher than a mass produced drug. The company still needs to run the same safety tests and there are a lot of other inefficiencies in small scale production. Your wife's drug could also be difficult to produce compared to other medicines. Even if the research was conducted by universities, a lot of the money could of come from drug companies. My cousin is doing neuro biology research at a top California university and nearly all of her program's funding comes a pharmacy company. This might not be the case for your wife's drug, but Big Pharma often hires universities to do a lot of its research. But the drug company also needs to make up for all the money it lost on research on other drugs that it failed to bring to market. It sucks for your family, but this could also be a factor for your wife's drug\n",
