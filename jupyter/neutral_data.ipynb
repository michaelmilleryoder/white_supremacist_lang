       "2        Thank you, thank you, thank you. \\n\\nRon Paul represents an evolving social/political consciousness. I don't think the country as a whole (or should I say as a hole) is willing to make that leap just yet, but Ron is representing the sentiment of a large demographic  who are sick of the corruption currently being lived through. The corruption, of course, isn't solely caused by the ones on top. The ones truly to blame are the populace as a whole who won't stand up to unjust behavior. Hence the importance of Ron: he's the only one expressing a sentiment that is needed for the country to evolve into something new and better.\\n\\nHe's no savior. He's just the one with the balls to say what needs to be said. Thank God. He may not become president, but he's changing people's minds for the better.    \n",

All I'm trying to tell you is that you need to provide something more than some lawyer's interpretation of the passage and your opinion in the matter in order to claim that other people are misinterpreting the passage since they are not evidences or facts. Or else you are just making a baseless claim and it would not be surprising that people don't agree with you.\n",

While they don't focus on terrorism and there has always a veneer of good vs evil and redemption,   the redemptions comes via morally ambiguous mass killings. I'm not arguing that GTA is breeding serial killers or anything like it, just that the subject matter of these games is as perverse and anti social as the subject matter on Fox News. \n",

       "46187  there are a lot of other factors that affect the cost as well. If your wife has a relatively rare bone marrow disease, a the costs will be a lot higher than a mass produced drug. The company still needs to run the same safety tests and there are a lot of other inefficiencies in small scale production. Your wife's drug could also be difficult to produce compared to other medicines. Even if the research was conducted by universities, a lot of the money could of come from drug companies. My cousin is doing neuro biology research at a top California university and nearly all of her program's funding comes a pharmacy company. This might not be the case for your wife's drug, but Big Pharma often hires universities to do a lot of its research. But the drug company also needs to make up for all the money it lost on research on other drugs that it failed to bring to market. It sucks for your family, but this could also be a factor for your wife's drug\n",

       "[' Believe it or not : Avatar takes 1 petabyte of storage space , equivalent to a 32 YEAR long MP3 .  Avatar , the movie Oscar winning Director James Cameron , is now the world \\'s most expensive movie ever made .  The movie has received enormous praise , particularly from the movie and tech blogosphere who have been blown away by the films 3D and CGI effects . Also , the movie currently sits at 26 on IMDB \\'s list of the most highly rated movies of all time , no mean feat .  One thing that particularly fascinated me however is Cameron \\'s use of a new 3D shooting technology called 3D Fusion . The technique requires an enormous amount of processing power , and needless to say , also a lot of storage space , but how much ?  The entire rendering of Avatar reportedly requires over 1 Petabyte of storage space according to BBC \\'s Clickbits , which is the equivalent of 500 harddrives of 2TB each . That \\'s equal to a 32 year long MP3 file ( in Miramar , New Zealand , ( population 8,334 ) in one of the most powerful purpose-built data centers in the world ( same place they created King Kong and Lord of the Rings ) . According to Information Management , the computing core -- 34 racks , each with four chassis of 32 machines each -- adds up to some 40,000 processors and 104 terabytes of RAM . The blades read and write against 3 petabytes of fast fiber channel disk network area storage from BluArc and NetApp .  All the gear sits tightly packed and connected by multiple 10-gigabit network links . \" We need to stack the gear closely to get the bandwidth we need for our visual effects , and , because the data flows are so great , the storage has to be local , \" says Paul Gunn , Weta \\'s data center systems administrator .  So before you wonder what someone did with a 300 million budget , it \\'s worth noting that just the storage costs of the movie would have been in the million range . Mind blowing . ',\n",

It \\'s the get-the-party-started anthem of the year , the fun kiss-off track that got Justin Timberlake dancing in a leotard on SNL , The Chipettes shaking their hips in Alvin and the Chipmunks : The Squeakquel and fans of every age , shape and size posting tributes to YouTube .  Nominated for three Grammys , Beyonc ? \\' s hit \" Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) , \" from her third solo album , I Am ... Sasha Fierce , has taken the world by storm . Peaking at No. 1 on the Billboard chart and staying on top for four non-consecutive weeks , the single dominated Hot 100 Airplay , topped U.K. , Canadian and Australian charts and , with over 3,000,000 digital downloads , became the singer \\'s highest-selling song .  But do you know the story behind the music and the moves ?  The Lyrics  \" about marriage , \" says the song \\'s producer Christopher \" Tricky \" Stewart . \" When we went into the studio she did n\\'t have a ring on or anything , because at that point they were still really hiding it . That \\'s where Dream got that concept from . \"  \" I thought it was a subject that most women wanted to talk about because most of us men are scared as s--- to be bound to a commitment , \" adds The-Dream ( real name : Terius Youngdell Nash ) .  The Sound  \" I always believe that every artist has a groove to them , \" says Tricky , who crafted the song \\'s shuffle beat . \" That rhythm is what she responds to , \" he adds . And once she had the rhythm locked in , she delivered the now-classic lines , \" on point right away , \" says vocal producer Kuk Harrell . \" She knows what she \\'s going for . \"  The Video  Spawning a massive dance craze and hundreds of YouTube tributes , \" were choreographed by Frank Gatson Jr . and JaQuel Knight .  \" She wanted it to feel good and powerful and she wanted something that everyone would do , \" says Knight . Beyonc ? \\' s main inspiration was the Bob Fosse-choreographed performance of \" Mexican Breakfast \" on The Ed Sullivan Show in 1969 and , says Gatson , \" Shirley MacLaine in Sweet Charity ... That is why Beyonc ? ran up the wall in the video . \"  Pair those moves and killer costumes , \" reminiscent of the high-cut leotards seen in both A Chorus Line and All That Jazz , but modern , \" according to designer Tina Knowles , and add a flash of that $5-million Lorraine Schwartz wedding ring , and it \\'s easy to see why \" Single Ladies \" became an instant classic .  \" I think the visual is what really pulled the record together as a whole , \" says Tricky . \" The reach was just unparalleled . \"  Watch the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards on Jan. 31 at 8 p.m .
