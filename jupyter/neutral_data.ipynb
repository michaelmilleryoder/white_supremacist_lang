       "2        Thank you, thank you, thank you. \\n\\nRon Paul represents an evolving social/political consciousness. I don't think the country as a whole (or should I say as a hole) is willing to make that leap just yet, but Ron is representing the sentiment of a large demographic  who are sick of the corruption currently being lived through. The corruption, of course, isn't solely caused by the ones on top. The ones truly to blame are the populace as a whole who won't stand up to unjust behavior. Hence the importance of Ron: he's the only one expressing a sentiment that is needed for the country to evolve into something new and better.\\n\\nHe's no savior. He's just the one with the balls to say what needs to be said. Thank God. He may not become president, but he's changing people's minds for the better.    \n",

       "2        Thank you, thank you, thank you. \\n\\nRon Paul represents an evolving social/political consciousness. I don't think the country as a whole (or should I say as a hole) is willing to make that leap just yet, but Ron is representing the sentiment of a large demographic  who are sick of the corruption currently being lived through. The corruption, of course, isn't solely caused by the ones on top. The ones truly to blame are the populace as a whole who won't stand up to unjust behavior. Hence the importance of Ron: he's the only one expressing a sentiment that is needed for the country to evolve into something new and better.\\n\\nHe's no savior. He's just the one with the balls to say what needs to be said. Thank God. He may not become president, but he's changing people's minds for the better.    \n",

       "      <td>there are a lot of other factors that affect the cost as well. If your wife has a relatively rare bone marrow disease, a the costs will be a lot higher than a mass produced drug. The company still needs to run the same safety tests and there are a lot of other inefficiencies in small scale production. Your wife's drug could also be difficult to produce compared to other medicines. Even if the research was conducted by universities, a lot of the money could of come from drug companies. My cousin is doing neuro biology research at a top California university and nearly all of her program's funding comes a pharmacy company. This might not be the case for your wife's drug, but Big Pharma often hires universities to do a lot of its research. But the drug company also needs to make up for all the money it lost on research on other drugs that it failed to bring to market. It sucks for your family, but this could also be a factor for your wife's drug</td>\n",

While they don't focus on terrorism and there has always a veneer of good vs evil and redemption,   the redemptions comes via morally ambiguous mass killings. I'm not arguing that GTA is breeding serial killers or anything like it, just that the subject matter of these games is as perverse and anti social as the subject matter on Fox News. \n",

       "46187  there are a lot of other factors that affect the cost as well. If your wife has a relatively rare bone marrow disease, a the costs will be a lot higher than a mass produced drug. The company still needs to run the same safety tests and there are a lot of other inefficiencies in small scale production. Your wife's drug could also be difficult to produce compared to other medicines. Even if the research was conducted by universities, a lot of the money could of come from drug companies. My cousin is doing neuro biology research at a top California university and nearly all of her program's funding comes a pharmacy company. This might not be the case for your wife's drug, but Big Pharma often hires universities to do a lot of its research. But the drug company also needs to make up for all the money it lost on research on other drugs that it failed to bring to market. It sucks for your family, but this could also be a factor for your wife's drug\n",
