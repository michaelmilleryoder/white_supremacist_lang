Unfortunately I had to let those spiders loose, before I had 4000 babies in my house. I will keep her number in mind if I find another, and probably call from someone else's phone when I have one available.

       "      <td>Quote:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOriginally Posted by curt york\\n\\n\\nMy main question is, why should the white race (by extension ANY race, but we'll focus on the white race because this is SF, a WN site) be protected?\\n\\nThe inevitable answer will be 'to preserve our culture'. In this case, I would like to have answered a question that I have never seen answered on the OV forum. What is white culture?\\n\\n\\n\\nIsn't it self-evident? White culture is the culmination of all achievement, art, music, history, heritage and culture that has developed within our race in Europe for as far back as anyone can speculate.\\n\\nThe fact that we have more of each one of those things than just about every other race combined, is exactly the foremost reason the White race deserves to be protected.\\n\\nHere is a question. Why doesn't the White race deserve to be protected, to survive? Do you promote genocide, or just act indifferently and sit back to allow it to happen? We wish to prevent it. Anyone who is not with us must be one of the former two. \\n\\nFor that matter, why doesn't every human race have the right to their own culture, heritage, preservation and survival? I assume you are one of those who would criticise English colonists for \"infringing\" on the culture and way of life of \"Native\" Americans. So why are you so passive and indifferent while it happens to other races right in front of you?\\n\\nWhite Nationalism is not solely for the protection of our people and peoples. It also promotes the survival of all other human races, because we are doing our part to prevent the bloodlines of Africans, Mongols, Middle-Easterns, Semites, and every other people on Earth from becoming muddled and having their cultures raped. \\n\\nThousands of years from now, there will be two types of people. Those few who remain pure, who retain the attributes and features given to the various races of man when they were designed; and those who have no national, cultural, or racial distinctions, and simply exist with nothing to recognise as the achievements of their ancestors, the cultures of their people, or any semblance of uniqueness or individuality. Those of us here are ensuring the existence of the former type, while those of us in opposition ensure the existence of the latter.</td>\n",

That book's blatantly biased and one-sided portrayal of the Third Reich led me to search for other histories, which I found here. That book reads more like a holocaust history than anything else, and Evans' summing up Nazism as this perpetual war ideology, committed only to bloodshed and conquest is a flat out lie. The war was forced upon Germany by other countries, and the actions committed against Germany were greater than the atrocities detailed in that book by a long shot.</td>\n",

I am sending a link. Now she paints faces on kids/ scroll down to see phone number and business? What would she want with a spider, or bats. That would totally scare her clients if they were children. Face Painting America? With further looking she wished to use these critters as educational specimens. I can see that, and she did list her right town and state. Unfortunately I had to let those spiders loose, before I had 4000 babies in my house. I will keep her number in mind if I find another, and probably call from someone else's phone when I have one available. If she knows nothing of widows, I suggest a less poisonous type for Educational Purposes! \\n\\nSanta Barbara CA Kids Party Theme, Entertainers for Kids Party in Santa Barbara CA ? PartyPOP US   \n",
       "286556  Quote:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOriginally Posted by curt york\\n\\n\\nMy main question is, why should the white race (by extension ANY race, but we'll focus on the white race because this is SF, a WN site) be protected?\\n\\nThe inevitable answer will be 'to preserve our culture'. In this case, I would like to have answered a question that I have never seen answered on the OV forum. What is white culture?\\n\\n\\n\\nIsn't it self-evident? White culture is the culmination of all achievement, art, music, history, heritage and culture that has developed within our race in Europe for as far back as anyone can speculate.\\n\\nThe fact that we have more of each one of those things than just about every other race combined, is exactly the foremost reason the White race deserves to be protected.\\n\\nHere is a question. Why doesn't the White race deserve to be protected, to survive? Do you promote genocide, or just act indifferently and sit back to allow it to happen? We wish to prevent it. Anyone who is not with us must be one of the former two. \\n\\nFor that matter, why doesn't every human race have the right to their own culture, heritage, preservation and survival? I assume you are one of those who would criticise English colonists for \"infringing\" on the culture and way of life of \"Native\" Americans. So why are you so passive and indifferent while it happens to other races right in front of you?\\n\\nWhite Nationalism is not solely for the protection of our people and peoples. It also promotes the survival of all other human races, because we are doing our part to prevent the bloodlines of Africans, Mongols, Middle-Easterns, Semites, and every other people on Earth from becoming muddled and having their cultures raped. \\n\\nThousands of years from now, there will be two types of people. Those few who remain pure, who retain the attributes and features given to the various races of man when they were designed; and those who have no national, cultural, or racial distinctions, and simply exist with nothing to recognise as the achievements of their ancestors, the cultures of their people, or any semblance of uniqueness or individuality. Those of us here are ensuring the existence of the former type, while those of us in opposition ensure the existence of the latter.   \n",

I think it's about as unbiased as a mainstream book on the leader is going to get. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nQuote:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOriginally Posted by Tank60\\n\\n\\nI'm reading the Third Reich at War. It's interesting to say the least.\\n\\n\\n\\nMy reading of that book coincided with my finding of this website. That book's blatantly biased and one-sided portrayal of the Third Reich led me to search for other histories, which I found here. That book reads more like a holocaust history than anything else, and Evans' summing up Nazism as this perpetual war ideology, committed only to bloodshed and conquest is a flat out lie. The war was forced upon Germany by other countries, and the actions committed against Germany were greater than the atrocities detailed in that book by a long shot.   \n",

Also, he's singing about it, so it's not like his people were ever truly wiped out. Instead, he's a slave now just like everyone else.   \n",

And there is also a line at the top of the board.\\nAt the last one you can see that what he was holding was smaller than what he now holds because of the place of the hands, he is holding a pile and a hand can't curle around a sign so that hand shoud be a bit down so that it's more on the pile.\\n\\n\\n\\nhuh? the kid appears to be holding two signs and as far as peoples hands not fitting around the handles correctly, who knows, could've been how they were carrying them at that moment..i'm sure they weren't worried about how they looked while holding the signs when photographed. \\n\\nThat could be explanations for the theories but who knows, thread started in graphics so maybe the thread starter was showing us what he can do\n",

Anyway, I was wondering if anyone could point me towards where I would get a nice picture of Yggdrassil, or the World Tree/Tree of life for a tattoo design. It features in both Norse and Celtic belief systems, and also in my own being a proud heathen. It is the tree that holds up the (White) world and from which all (White) life springs.\\n\\nAny ideas?\\n\\nThanks for your time!\\n\\nRacial Salutes,\\nDraiodoir,\\n14/88"

I am also currently working to get my Master's certification. Texas is a welcoming state and I have settled in as a young adult in the harsh modern world; especially when the modern world is full of degeneracy.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\tOpinions and Political Upbringing \\n \\n\\n\\n\\tMy earliest political thoughts arose when I was young and naive, as many in the modern age do thanks to the exposure to media. It's simple to say that I was a typical teenager in terms of political belief in my early days, Freedom for everyone, Welfare for everyone, College should be free;it was nonsense, all of it. Later on I slid down the slope to an even more brainwashed ideology, communism. My communist days were easily when I was at my worst, espousing fantastical nonsense that I thoroughly defended from historical convictions. Eventually those days came to and end, though through more ironic means. Once I started reading on economics (Keynesian economics mostly.) I came to dissuade myself from Communism, eventually despising it. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\tFascism was eventually the center stage of politics for me. It had begun when I started delving into finer studies such as Philosophy and Buddhist Spirituality. Needless to say that I am pleased with the community and belief set that Fascism retains.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\tOther\\n \\n\\n\\n\\tTo add briefly, I am a person who seeks to learn and discuss amongst peers of similar opinions. I am also an individual who looks forward to writing about the ideas I hope to attain from visiting a community such as this.</td>\n",

This could include theological discussion, scriptural interpretation, history, relationship with politics, or just about anything. It is a relatively broad topic but I thought it would be a good idea to kind of stream line it and place it all in one place. \\nTo get the ball rolling, I thought I would post a few of my favorite verses that I feel counter some of the preconceived notions of Christianity and Jesus Christ as being \"weak\". \\n  \\n\\nFrom his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.-Revelation 19:15 \\n\\nDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.-Matthew 10:34 \\n\\nAnd making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. And he told those who sold the pigeons, \"Take these things away; do not make my Fathers house a house of trade.-John 2:15-17 \\n\\n...and repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them.

Originally it was mostly just British and French but has since come to include many others, around 1 million Canadians have a Ukrainian background for example. It's not a European nation in the sense it is not located in Europe however it was Europeans responsible for the establishment of the state of Canada. Over here it's a bit different, it is impossible to be loyal to simply a single European ethnic group because of the reality you so clearly stated, hence why North American national socialism must be pan-European in spirit. All that really matters is that we are of the larger European race and that is what really counts.\n",

I am also currently working to get my Master's certification. Texas is a welcoming state and I have settled in as a young adult in the harsh modern world; especially when the modern world is full of degeneracy.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\tOpinions and Political Upbringing \\n \\n\\n\\n\\tMy earliest political thoughts arose when I was young and naive, as many in the modern age do thanks to the exposure to media. It's simple to say that I was a typical teenager in terms of political belief in my early days, Freedom for everyone, Welfare for everyone, College should be free;it was nonsense, all of it. Later on I slid down the slope to an even more brainwashed ideology, communism. My communist days were easily when I was at my worst, espousing fantastical nonsense that I thoroughly defended from historical convictions. Eventually those days came to and end, though through more ironic means. Once I started reading on economics (Keynesian economics mostly.) I came to dissuade myself from Communism, eventually despising it. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\tFascism was eventually the center stage of politics for me. It had begun when I started delving into finer studies such as Philosophy and Buddhist Spirituality. Needless to say that I am pleased with the community and belief set that Fascism retains.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\tOther\\n \\n\\n\\n\\tTo add briefly, I am a person who seeks to learn and discuss amongst peers of similar opinions. I am also an individual who looks forward to writing about the ideas I hope to attain from visiting a community such as this.\n",

He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.-Revelation 19:15 \\n\\nDo not suppose that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I did not come to bring peace, but a sword.-Matthew 10:34 \\n\\nAnd making a whip of cords, he drove them all out of the temple, with the sheep and oxen. And he poured out the coins of the money-changers and overturned their tables. And he told those who sold the pigeons, \"Take these things away; do not make my Fathers house a house of trade.-John 2:15-17 \\n\\n...and repays to their face those who hate him, by destroying them. He will not be slack with one who hates him. He will repay him to his face.-Deuteronomy 7:10\n",

If the origins are biological or psychological it must be treated, via forceful internment if necessary. If no treatment works then it's either incarceration or labor camps or execution, that's a matter of policy for a given NS state to decide. Faggots who are such because they are just hedonistic scum shouldn't even be given the option of treatment and rehabilitation.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\tEDIT: mind you, all of the above is post-victory. On Day of the Rope and during the Race War ain't nobody gonna have time for any of that, all faggots will be getting the noose straight away when shit hits the fan.\n",
