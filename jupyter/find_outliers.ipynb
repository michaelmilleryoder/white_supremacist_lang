[ ... ] the suspected ringleader - a 34-year-old asylum seeker - was stopped as he drove to the shops . he was being questioned last night . police believe they have crushed a network responsible for the 'organised theft , alteration and subsequent re-sale of large quantities of items that have been stolen from within the royal mail postal system across london and other parts of the uk . ' [ ... ] the gang 's supply line came from corrupt royal mail workers who visited every afternoon to hand over stolen mail . sacks of post contained thousands of credit and debit cards , cheque books , benefit books and other department of work and pensions documents . a single benefit book can be worth as much as £350 to a fraudster who will used forged dates and identity documents to cash it before it is reported missing .

' the defendant was found guilty of two charges of indecency with a child and six of indecent assault after a trial . prosecutor katherine dunn told the court it was in 2009 the victim , who is now an adult , broke her silence about what leighton had done to her . the court heard that at a special meeting at lambton kingdom hall aimed at 'keeping the congregation clean ' , leighton 'admitted sexual abuse ' and made excuses for his vile behaviour . miss dunn said : 'the elders conducted their own investigation . a meeting was arranged and the defendant was confronted with the allegations .

'' with these words a black police inspector from tembisa on the east rand allegedly scolded the victims of an armed robbery and hijacking attempt in kempton park on monday night . this officer , whose name is known to beeld , apparently refused to arrest a black suspect on the scene . he also refused to open a case after nic lubbe , 51 , from kempton park west , his daughter , antoenet cronjé , and her two sons , morné , 11 , and kyle , 3 , were assailed by robbers on monday night . 'white dogs ' he ostensibly also refused to allow white members of the norkem park police to search the suspects ' car and called them `` white dogs '' . lubbe said he was on his way to drop off his daughter and grandchildren at their house in terrenure at about 23:00 when he saw a grey corsa bakkie next to the road in orange river street . suddenly the corsa bakkie 's headlights went on to blind lubbe . then it was driven into lubbe 's bakkie from behind . three armed men jumped off the back and grabbed cronjé 's handbag . lubbe sped away and later returned to the scene with his wife , mara , 49 , and members of the norkem park police office . a black inspector from the tembisa roadblock task team was already there with one of the suspects ( the driver of the corsa ) . the other three got away . `` the inspector said we were white dogs and he told a white policewoman that he would see to it that she was shot dead in a robbery . `` then he cocked his r5 ( rifle ) in my face and said it was time that we whites packed our bags and * * * * ed off out of the country .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] jenkins 's book also mentions this , but claims she was abducted to be the wife of one of the american deserters . the romanian foreign office 's website says romania asked north korea in 2007 to explain bumbea 's abduction but did not receive an answer . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] bumbea died of lung cancer . after bumbea 's death , dresnok married his third wife , the daughter of a north korean woman and a togolese diplomat . they had a son in 2001 . the family lives in a small apartment in pyongyang , provided along with a monthly stipend by the north korean government . dresnok is in failing health , with a bad heart and liver ( dresnok describes his liver as `` full of fat '' ) , which he attributes to smoking and drinking too much . [ 4 ] his elder son from his second marriage , james dresnok , was a student at pyongyang university of foreign studies , where his father taught english in the 1980s . james speaks english with a korean accent and considers himself korean but reportedly does not wish to marry a korean woman . james intends to enter the diplomatic service . [ 4 ] dresnok has stated that he intends to spend the rest of his life in north korea , and that no amount of money could entice him back to the west . now retired , dresnok occasionally gives lectures in north korea and goes fishing “ just to pass the time. ” [ 4 ] he may sporadically tweet under the handle @ jamesdresnok -- first posting back in september 2009 -- but the authenticity of the account could not be verified .

( what happens when the nose of the craft is lowered ? ) how is the whitehead machine controllable ? i 'm familiar with wing warping which was used with some degree of success in early designs but appears to be absent here . the engine appears to be much too heavy for the craft and where are the compressed air cylinders ? the wright brothers built an aluminum alloy combustion engine to overcome weight issues . the so called exact replica is flying like a kite and does not appear to be manned . this thing may have gotten airborne downhill in a strong wind but is nothing more than a kite waiting for natures forces to bring it back to earth .  \n",

       "stormfront_25154         so out of curiosity i google my stormfront name and i found that i have been quoted on a site , which i found amusing . i like the way he didnt quote the whole conversation and the fact i banned his ip . electrical audio & bull ; view topic - seriously compressing the dumb * * * * quote : i wandered into a white power chat room out of boredom . called myself ken for some reason . sounds like a white guys name . ken joined the chat ken : any punk fans here ? ken : wondering how we can get the black influence out of punk rock nachtmahr joined the chat 8 seconds ago ken : high-hats come from jazz ( filthy ) and the bass drum comes from the middle east ( ugh ) and toms come from africa ( disgusting ) nachtmahr : hi ken : and the modern guitar was developed by black blues players ken : i think racially pure punk should be made with white instruments ken : maybe a lute and a whistle ? ken : anyone know of bands like that ? but kind of sound like the clash ? nachtmahr : the only music that iknow of that would be considered 'white ' is the lord of the rings theme tunes nachtmahr : nachtmahr : but i 'm not sure if you will get any white music that sounds like the clash not using those instruments ken : thats cool but i think i saw a jew playing cello . why is the white man always playing second fiddle ? ken : how about hip hop with white instruments ? something like wu tang but made with a harpsichord ? ken : i bought a harpsichord off ebay once but when it arrived it was baroque nachtmahr : ahh , do you play many instuments ? ken : i 'm learning tablas but its hard nachtmahr : well its more than me . i cant play anything quote : ken : hey , whats stormfronts position on gays ? nachtmahr : i think its genrally not really liked becasue it does n't contribute to the white race , but many people feel that if they do n't have to see it its fine ken : yeah , i wouldnt do anything with a guy out in public nachtmahr : well then i think it 's fine on stormfront ken : and you 're right about not contributing to the white race . thats why i think it doesnt matter if i * * * * black guys and asian guys because there 's no way we can breed , innit ? ken : i 'd only breed with a white woman ken : ( maybe half black , like that one spice girl . then the kid would be 3/4 white and get 3/4 of my respect ) ken : so ... you got any photos of you ? nachtmahr : ha , no . not for you anyway . ken : shame , you sound fit ken : nice , sexy skinhead . you shave anywhere else ? nachtmahr : through the small amount of text you have concured that i 'm 'fit ' ? nachtmahr : no . ken : arent you fit ? nachtmahr : i 'm not even a skinhead . troll fail . ken : sorry mate , i only * * * * skins . nice try . bye i would like to point out i realised he was a troll when he started talking about musical instruments . i posted lotr music , just becasue i was listening to it at the time . quote : nice work tanx . back in the late 90 's when i first got on the internet , i infiltrated a white power group and slowly ramped up the madness and bulldada until they disbanded . anyone else been intrestingly quoted on other sites ?  \n",

'' to a country we send charity every year in big amounts , we take them here and they contribute to crime stats , then people who say that will be silenced and de-platformed , then they will perform bad in schools and then the same snake that stoof on the podium to tell you how these people need out help are not any worse than the german michel , they will say `` it 's just unfair treatment '' and `` inherit racism '' there is no appeasing any social progressive or social freedom group . we have worker unions , we had great pensions , even if you do n't have a job you can have a steady household without fearing hunger or death , you just ca n't buy coke all week ( loo boo ) socialists and people constantly advocating for x-rights deserve the most of all the bullet , but i would never try to uphold these kinds of people in a political landscape because i know its a wasted vote , because these kind of people never surpass 5 % to even represent me .  \n",

'' it 's about 0.15 % from what i found . as for the amount of families thats because they chose not put them in a home for people like that . i still say its bad to `` get rid of people '' like that . we should n't have a view of killing when it comes to our people . we should have a kinder view toward our own . if we behave like that it would only lead to people like you taking a high powered rifle to someone with autism or any other slight problem eventually .  \n",

'' with these words a black police inspector from tembisa on the east rand allegedly scolded the victims of an armed robbery and hijacking attempt in kempton park on monday night . this officer , whose name is known to beeld , apparently refused to arrest a black suspect on the scene . he also refused to open a case after nic lubbe , 51 , from kempton park west , his daughter , antoenet cronjé , and her two sons , morné , 11 , and kyle , 3 , were assailed by robbers on monday night . 'white dogs ' he ostensibly also refused to allow white members of the norkem park police to search the suspects ' car and called them `` white dogs '' . lubbe said he was on his way to drop off his daughter and grandchildren at their house in terrenure at about 23:00 when he saw a grey corsa bakkie next to the road in orange river street . suddenly the corsa bakkie 's headlights went on to blind lubbe . then it was driven into lubbe 's bakkie from behind . three armed men jumped off the back and grabbed cronjé 's handbag . lubbe sped away and later returned to the scene with his wife , mara , 49 , and members of the norkem park police office . a black inspector from the tembisa roadblock task team was already there with one of the suspects ( the driver of the corsa ) . the other three got away . `` the inspector said we were white dogs and he told a white policewoman that he would see to it that she was shot dead in a robbery . `` then he cocked his r5 ( rifle ) in my face and said it was time that we whites packed our bags and * * * * ed off out of the country . '' an eyewitness apparently heard the inspector 's offensive remarks . `` i saw how these people were robbed , but he protected the criminal .

[ 10 ] [ 11 ] jenkins 's book also mentions this , but claims she was abducted to be the wife of one of the american deserters . the romanian foreign office 's website says romania asked north korea in 2007 to explain bumbea 's abduction but did not receive an answer . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] bumbea died of lung cancer . after bumbea 's death , dresnok married his third wife , the daughter of a north korean woman and a togolese diplomat . they had a son in 2001 . the family lives in a small apartment in pyongyang , provided along with a monthly stipend by the north korean government . dresnok is in failing health , with a bad heart and liver ( dresnok describes his liver as `` full of fat '' ) , which he attributes to smoking and drinking too much . [ 4 ] his elder son from his second marriage , james dresnok , was a student at pyongyang university of foreign studies , where his father taught english in the 1980s . james speaks english with a korean accent and considers himself korean but reportedly does not wish to marry a korean woman . james intends to enter the diplomatic service .

'' and that would have been the truth . germany only had oil for 2 months of war time operations out of every 12 months without the oil the were sold from stalin . but stalin did n't say that , because he wanted a shared border to germany so he could easily make a suprise attack instead of attacking through poland first . this is why he also attacked and occupied estonia , lithuania , latvia , northern romania and finland from 1939 to 1941 . all the peoples who fall under the “ protection ” of victorious germany will also become our allies . we will have a broad field of action for development of the world revolution . - joseph stalin , speech at a meeting in the politburo of the part central committee , august 19 , 1939 according to this agreement , it turned out that hitler started the war . this was beneficial for us from the military and from the moral standpoint . with his actions , he would provoke war with france and england , by going against poland . we could remain neutral . —n . khrushchev the red army will consider its bolshevik mission complete when it achieves control of the entire globe . — jan gamarnik , chief of the political directorat of the red army , in a speech given at a meeting of the national committee for defense of the ussr on march 15 , 1937 guys , would n't it be cool if we expanded germany towards the east ? - adolf hitler , age 33 , mein kampf 1922  \n",

      "to expand , it is clear that neither the past nor the future exist . the past existed ( meaning it no longer exists ) and the future does not yet exists ( meaning it is not in a state of existence ) . what exists is a single point of now . the way in which we measure time depends on something called a transcendental concept , as defined first by immanuel kant . a transcendental concept must have these attributes : be arbitrarily divisible unto the physical universe , be necessarily true . time is real in as much as numbers are real . 1+1=2 is true whether humans exist or not , same with the concept of time as we apply it to the universe . it exists , just not physically , it exists as a transcendental . think of it this way : -existence ( concept ) -existence < -+existence ( concept ) , time = +/-existence+/-existence , in that we can never actually grasp time by the actual present moment , but rather we divide unto the universe the concept of changes between the future and the past to an arbitrary present moment to find time .\n",

      "the real-human a human that seeks to be the ideal human to and constantly improve himself in all aspects of his being to the best of his ability , while also knowing his own limited and flawed nature and the reality that only a select few humans could ever truly be the ideal man , but still strives for it . this model , is perfectly reachable by every human , because while we are all more or less flawed and limited , each in our different ways , we still have many aspects of ourselves in which we can always improve upon and strive towards the full potential . though realities of life do make it impossible for us to strive for constant improvement in all of those aspects , there is no excuse for not improving ourselves in aspects we know we can improve , and thus become closer to the ideal human . the sub-human a human that is not striving to be the ideal-human , and does not seek to improve himself despite having the capacity to do so and thus wastes his potential , or even worse , a human that acts in such ways that weaken and degrade him , and thus push himself further away from his full potential . unfortunately , it seems that wast majority of people are sub-human .\n",

      "the industrial revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race . they have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “ advanced ” countries , but they have destabilized society , have made life unfulfilling , have subjected human beings to indignities , have led to widespread psychological suffering ( in the third world to physical suffering as well ) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world . the continued development of technology will worsen the situation . it will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world , it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering , and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “ advanced ” countries .\n",

      "how our biological instinct to reproduce is the purpose of life it was the purpose of life before we achieved any semblance of conciousness ; its a far more fundamental cornerstone to all life than consciousness . its far superior to consciousness as a `` basis for meaning '' too , since consciousness is contingent upon it ( but that 's a tangent ) . you realize , that within the framework of your biology , and the physical laws underpinning it , you have to decide the meaning of your existence , correct ? but you are n't given infinite margins within which to make that decision : you have to preserve the foundation of consciousness , and preserve it in its current form , or else you lose the space for meaning of any kind , not just the kind you prefer . do you still follow ?\n",
      "\n",
      "the sort of bureaucratic thinking alienates the best and invites the worst . you are wrong to shame the individual . it should not be the presumption of status , as in being human entitles you to rights , but , individuality is an important factor in man 's psychology . when man thinks of himself he reveals himself , his beliefs and values , and this translates more into his greater loyalties ; the family , the nation , the state , the race . his personal desire for wealth is to satisfy these , as well has his needs . the true individual , a free thinker , can not be coerced into service , but the blind mass can . these are not the ones to whom i refer . not every man has personality or talent .\n",

      "because we relied on kindness and cooperation to survive , we as a people maintain bonds of brotherhood and friendship more than any other and after millennia of being surrounded for the most part only by others who reciprocate such feelings and ideals due to a similar environment and development , we come into contact with peoples that never developed such bonds or indeed much of anything else . in the early days we recognised this immediately as they were foreign to our people and we could understand exactly how and why that was , however we as a people develop bonds quickly and eventually our altruism and goodwill won out , over and over again . it 's in part our single greatest quality , making us more truly human than most other peoples of the earth but it 's also evidently our greatest weakness .\n",
      "\n",
      "animals are basically autonomous machines as it is , they perform a niche task and possess zero self awareness . you are wrong . every single animal with at the very least a cns , and some without one , are self aware creatures with a consciousness . they work in almost exactly the same way as a human brain , with the same connections and electro-chemical receptors and all life on earth evolved from the same sources . humans are obviously far more intelligent and superior to animals , but to believe animals do n't have a consciousness but humans magically do is n't logically sound . it is special pleading . you are wrong .\n",
      "\n",
      "your views are philosophically self defeating . you do n't find any value in life beyond hedonistic experience . life only has value because it is a finite quantity . scarcity is built into this system . the amount and type of experiences that humans can have are inherently limited . things are hard for us to do , we have to struggle , our time is limited , and that makes what we achieve have meaning . entropy ensures that absolutely all of existences has a shelf life . there is no eternity in the physical world . attempting to claw and fight for another fleeting day rather than coming to peace with the nature of existence is by definition infantile .\n",
      "\n",
      "because `` meaning '' means something to me . i find that hard to believe while you have none , and think you can create none , and that you can see none , except for `` fleeting beauty now and then '' . i think you refuse to create meaning , perhaps as a habit , perhaps because of some deficit in your development where you failed to realize that meaning required agency to exist . you think meaning has to be handed to you , prefabricated ; but that is truly a `` false '' notion of meaning , a truly inauthentic kind of meaning . even the meaning we inherit is only a framework for our addition to it ; it dies , it falls fallow , if we do not cultivate it . your sense of meaning is sterile , and thus , meaning has abandoned you .\n",
      "\n",
      "so i finally finished the doctrine of awakening and found the resolution to the conflict between evolution and involution , that is to say the rejection of evolution in these teachings . the reality of the conflict arises from the false attribution to evolution of a qualitative character and from the relative relation between the material and immaterial worlds . if you think of evolution as moving from an inferior to a superior place then that 's a wrong interpretation , a progressivist one . when you think about it as just adaptive change it loses the qualitative point that creates the misconception . the other aspect is that to the doctrines in question any material world changes in terms of `` becoming '' are irrelevant , because they in reality still pertain to the material world and thus no true qualitative change occurs . so evolution becomes irrelevant to these teachings rather than something that is opposed in principle . so we may acknowledge evolution but only insofar as it does not claim progressive qualitative change which is the source of the conflict and so far as it is change that simply means just that , change from one state to another based in adaptive , selective principles then it is irrelevant . change of purely material adaptive character is irrelevant to the only substantial change recognized by the spiritual doctrines concerned only with change from material to the immaterial and regarding qualitative degeneration .\n",
      "\n",
      "freedom is really only an ideal that requires the context of a society to exist . outside a society there is no freedom because it is rooted in the context of a society . what you describe is simply free will , which exists outside societal context and exists universally . you will always have the ability to choose its simply a layer of consciousness . as long as your are aware of your surroundings and maintain a degree of autonomy you will have free will , and therefore will have the ability to choose and the decisions that follow irregardless of your quality or quantity of decisions to make ..\n",
      "\n",
      "perhaps this world was created by a higher entity for a good reason . perhaps `` lie '' is nothing but a negative judgement of life derived from our own inability to deal with such limitations . can we even imagine a life without limitations , least of all yearn for it ? that life would be indistinguishable from death . likewise , the honest human being you talk about is entirely dependent upon the existence of `` dishonesty '' to perceive himself as such . if he 's truly honest , then he 'd come to the realization that transcending the conditions which allow his honest self would be the annihilation of the self , and to will it is nihilism .\n",
      "\n",
      "the whole point of existance , even considering the `` big bang '' , is that there was an existance before time . one that human observation can not understand . in the relevance of something being `` eternal '' it means that the perception of time is nearly eternal . now in that understanding there is an idea that anything relative can happen within nearly infinite instances of spacetime . the multiverse theory helps substantiate such . so when time goes on for nearly all of existence then anything is feasible , mainly because there is so much information within spacetime . this is what makes me believe in intelligent design\n",
      "\n",
      "its not uncommon for trends or ideas to have a certain momentum to them . a sort of societal apathetic depression could have the same . the mouse population reached a critical mass where they had been exposed to something they 'd fundamentally never experience in nature . their group behavior was irreparably changed by this , and the group itself is a variable in the environment that others live around . a broken system begets broken individuals , and individuals beget other broken individuals until the point that they 're so broken they longer reproduce in any meaningful capacity .\n",

      "any political system must first and foremost ensure the survival , the continued physical existence , of the community it serves . after that comes ensuring the prosperity and liberty of this community in the best possible way . however , when i look at the situation in western countries today , i can not see that democracy always ensures our liberty or prosperity , and in many cases it functions so poorly that it threatens our very survival . perhaps in order to ensure our continued existence , we need to supplement democracy with other tools in our toolkit .\n",
      "\n",
      "from the beginning , since the day man first dared to exert his will as a living thinking creature there were certain aspects discovered to exist within the natural order of things , contrary forces as it were by which man , as the universe itself , is entirely self-regulating . it has been the misfortune of those wishing to cling to an orderly cosmos that such regulatory forces have been abandoned in the name of a common humanity , which is an altogether foolish assumption in that it 's based on a premise that is aligned against nature .\n",
      "\n",
      "a theory with regards to science and not vernacular language basically amounts to something that has been tested over and over and over and has produced the same results time and time again . it 's borderline fact , but we can almost never have any facts in science , because for whatever reason every x years even what we assume are the most fundamental principles of the world end up having a scenario where they do n't work . newton 's laws of motion for example have already seen cases where they do n't work or the law is too simplistic to fully detail a particular phenomenon .\n",
      "\n",
      "what ’ s more , the sense of coherence many of us maintain over our beliefs reflects both knowledge and emotion . being settled in what you believe feels good . ambivalence doesn ’ t . so to change someone ’ s mind , you also need to address their emotional attachment to what they believe . feeling even slight reservations about your current beliefs can set the stage for shifting more of your support toward an alternative point of view . yes , the human does n't like cognitive dissonance for the most part .\n",

      "it does n't take two years for a mother/child bond to form . where did you get that information ? a mother-child bond is continously forming until that child is no longer a child . where as you think she over-estimates , i think she under-estimates . the great nation of sweeden , gives 3 years paid maternity leave . with hot chicks and maternity leave the arabs are flooding in two year olds on prozac ? i would n't put anything past the jew , but yea this does sound a little far fetched . they do n't place 6 week old babies infront of the tv all day . i 've never seen a daycare with a tv , unless it 's for viewing videos once a week for older children . why brain-wash with t.v , their are much more effective visual and audial ( is that a word ? ) methods that daycares employ . teens medicated for emontional issues , simply because the parents do n't commuincate with their children as they are growing up . you need to talk to your children , find out how they feel , be involved in their lives as much as you can . you contradict yourself `` be involved in their lifes as much as you can . '' that is what we are arguing ! work is an un-necessary obstacle towards that goal . i stayed home for 3 years with my son . i talk to my son every day about how school went , if anything happend , ect . i am not a stay at home mom according to sweeden you are . and my son is a happy healthy child . i think working mom 's or stay at home mom 's ... as long as they can communicate openly with their children , be involved with school , and other issues in their lives , their children are happy and healthy . how is a full-time employed mother supposed to take on another full-time job ? your asking mom 's to burn themselves out , just so they can show men that they can work . light ! any good guy knows that his wife is doing more work and more good than him ! in my post earlier about chivalry , i think you should read that , since it defines how mom 's get the better deal than dad 's , for the most part .\n",

твоя юнаклък - кахпелък ! я ми разпори клето сръце , да си видиш какво сръце ми бележи , да си видиш какъв съм аз юнак . послуша го марко блъгарина , че разпори клетото му сръце , изправиле са са до девет сръца , а десетьо люта змия . изправи са люта змия , та си клъцна марко блъгарина , та го клъцна на челото , на челото между двете вежди . тъй загина марко блъгарина , загинаха до два ми юнака , тъй им било йот бога писано .\n",

      "национальный социализм и роль личности wotanjugend доктор петр николаевич иванов , один из авторов газеты “ новое слово ” – печатного органа русских национал-социалистов в третьем райхе , опубликовал в 1942 году важный текст о роли личности в национал-социалистическом государстве и принципиальном отличии последнего от государства марксистского : марксизм , игнорирующий роль духовного начала – это теория развития общества полуживотных , но отнюдь не людей . принятие идей марксизма не может не повести к регрессу человечества , к обратному движению в направлении дикого первобытного состояния , ибо культ материальных интересов неизбежно будет пробуждать и обострять самые грубые , неизменные инстинкты , а игнорирование принципа личной заинтересованности обеспечит падение общего материального уровня , не говоря уже о духовном . результаты владычества марксистских идей на протяжении четверти века в россии , являются прекрасным подтверждением только что сказанного : разрушение морали и семьи , разрушение религии и уничтожение чувства чести и долга , подмена культуры духа бессмысленным зазубриванием цитат из сочинений « классиков » марксизма , хроническое обнищание деревни , – вот те плоды , которые вырастил марксизм на широких просторах нашей родины . растлевающее влияние марксизма не могло не возбудить соответствующей реакции . человеческий дух не мог не восстать против угрозы звероподобного господства материи , грозившего уничтожением не только культурных ценностей человечества , но и его самого . и это восстание свершилось – германский народ , породивший величайших философов и политиков нового и новейшего времени ( канта , гегеля , ницше и бисмарка ) , породил и адольфа гитлера , поднявшего знамя крестового похода европы против иудо-марксизма . совершенно закономерно новое идейное движение , поднявшееся на борьбу с марксизмом , зародилось именно в германии . с одной стороны , – именно германскому народу в высокой степени присущи чувства национального единения и прочного государственного уклада , с другой стороны , – германия , уже имевшая перед глазами опыт русской « пролетарской » революции , сама , в свою очередь , стояла перед угрозой близкого коммунистического восстания . и именно потому , что почва в германии была уже исторически подготовлена к восприятию нового идейного учения , гениальные способности адольфа гитлера , как вождя , организатора и агитатора , позволяли ему в поразительно короткий исторический срок не только организационно оформить новое учение , но и сделать его могучей силой мирового и исторического значения . невозможность дальнейшего культурного прогресса человечества без радикального и насильственного изменения социально-экономических основ старого капиталистического мира была адольфу гитлеру совершенно ясна . и именно поэтому он совершил в своей стране социальную революцию , но так как революция была направлена не только против капитализма , но и против марксизма , ведущего социальную борьбу под лозунгами интернационализма и главенства материи , то на революционных знаменах партии адольфа гитлера был написан лозунг : « за социализм , на здоровой национальной основе , за победу высокого человеческого духа над низменной материей » . эти идеи германской национал-социалистической рабочей партии , сумевшие объединить , поднять и вдохновить на борьбу не только германский народ , но и все молодые , прогрессивные народы европы , служит ярчайшим доказательствам значения и роли человеческого духа в истории развития человеческого общества . ибо эти идеи являются продуктом гениальных способностей одного человека , сумевшего еще в юные годы распознать всю растлевающую сущность марксистского учения и выработать в себе основы того миросозерцания , которому бесспорно принадлежит громадное историческое будущее . эта историческая перспектива национал-социалистического учения определяется не только его социалистическим содержанием : ведь марксизм тоже ведет борьбу за социализм . сила , жизненность и творческая способность социализма адольфа гитлера заключается в том , что этот социализм строится на основе признания исключительной и руководящей роли человеческого духа и на признании громадного культурного значения победы человеческого духа над материей . именно поэтому национал-социалистическое учение обеспечивает и подлинную культуру , и подлинный прогресс человеческого общества во всех областях его жизни . человеческий дух всегда находит наиболее яркое свое воплощение в личности отдельного человека ; коллектив гасит и мертвит человеческий дух , ибо коллектив – это безвольная , мертвая масса , одухотворяемая только извне , но отнюдь не изнутри . так как марксизм исходит из представления о примате материи над духом и так как только человеческий дух мог поднять оружие против марксизма , то реализация идей марксизма была основана прежде всего на жесточайшем подавлении отдельной человеческой личности и на полном и безусловном поглощении ее коллективом . так как национал-социализм видит основную движущую силу развития общества в человеческом духе , то победа идей национализма ведет к подъему и расцвету человеческого общества на основе подъема и рассвета отдельной человеческой личности и создания максимально благоприятных условий для наиболее полного выявления индивидуальных способностей каждого отдельного члена общества . именно эта здоровая , индивидуальная , духовная основа национал-социалистического учения обуславливает его силу , его прогрессивность , историческую закономерность и неизбежность его окончательной победы . если марксизм превращал человека в полуживотное , лишенное лучших ярких духовных качеств , то национал-социализм поднял на щите человеческую личность так высоко , как она еще никогда не стояла . и именно этот щит делает национал-социализм непобедимым . автор : проф.-докт . п. иванов , источник – газета “ новое слово ” берлин №87 ( 469 ) , воскресенье , 1 ноября 1942 года , с.4-5 .\n",

      "хеймдалль , страж богов wotanjugend даже среди возвышенных æsir этот бог выделяется происхождением и необыкновенным значением , которым он обладает в германской мифологии . хеймдалль - белый витязь и страж богов ; днём и ночью несёт он свою вахту с мокрой спиной у моста бифрост , охраняя радугу , по которой проходят асы , поднимаясь в валхаллу , от непрошеных гостей , прежде всего , великанов . возле моста находятся его чертоги , химинбьёрг , небесные горы . хеймдалль видит всё на сотни миль вокруг себя , ночью не хуже , чем днём ; его слух запрятан под деревом иггдрасиль рядом с источником мимира и всё же он слышит как растёт трава и шерсть вырастает на овцах . другие имена хеймдалля - халлинскиди и гуллинтани ( златозубый ) , а также виндлери ( то есть , морской ветер ) . атрибуты хеймдалля - меч , которым воин охраняет вход в царство богов , причём меч так тесно связан с символикой светлого бога , что в скальдической поэзии зовётся его головой или голова зовётся мечом хеймдалля , конь гулльтоп ( `` золотая чёлка '' ) и рог гьяллархорн , звук которого слышал во всех девяти мирах , в который он протрубит в конце времён при приближении вражеского войска ( этот рог сравнивают то с трубой архангела , предвещающего апокалипсис , то с рогом роланда , призывающего подмогу , то с морскими раковинами , в которые трубят герои индусского у хеймдалля необычная родословная : светлый ас считается сыном одина и девяти матерей йотунской породы , которые являются сёстрами , их имена : грейп , гиалп , ейстла , иргиафа , ульфрун , ангейя , имд , атла и , наконец , ярнсакса . наиболее достоверная теория признаёт их дочерьми морского бога эгира и его супруги ран , иначе говоря , матери хеймдалля являются морскими волнами . любопытно , что индийский бог агни рождается из воды от нескольких матерей числом от двух от девяти . а в уэльском фольклоре имеются указания , что морские волны движутся по девять и каждая девятая несёт в себе барана ( который прочно ассоциируется с хеймдаллем ) . сам же хеймдалль является отцом для всех человеческих существ и прежде всего - для культурных , возвышенных белых народов , создающих цивилизацию . в евгеническом мифе , изложенном в `` песне о риге '' хеймдалль под этим именем отправляется в мидгард , чтобы одухотворить , усовершенствовать тех примитивных человекоподобных особей , что жили в срединном мире до того момента и в первую очередь он создаёт семейство трелла , раба - темнокожего и морщинистого , сутулого и безобразного внешне . на следующем этапе хеймдалль творит новую расу , род карла , свободного человека - рыжеволосого , румяного , с живыми глазами . и только на третьем заключительном этапе этого алхимического процесса возникает вершина творения , род ярла , господина , то есть , белый человек : сына мать родила , спеленала шелками , водой окропила , он назван был ярлом ; румяный лицом , а волосы светлые , взор его был , как змеиный , страшен . хеймдалль не только творит разумную жизнь на земле , но и делится знаниями со своими потомками , обучая их тем навыкам и умениям , которые соответствуют их природе : род трелла годится , прежде всего , для физической работы , род карла - для ремесла и сельского хозяйства , род ярла же создан для войны , освоения необжитых земель , покорения водных просторов и , в конечном итоге , для творчества . поэтому хеймдалль считается основоположником не только различных народов , но и социальной организации , кастовой иерархии общества , а также , законодателем . `` песнь о риге '' ясно свидетельствует о том , что уже в весьма отдалённую эпоху у язычников северной европы имелось представление и о расовой теории , и об улучшении породы , и о происхождении жизни и социальной структуре . кроме того , текст песни вполне отчётливо намекает , что хеймдалль в германских представлениях был не просто воином на страже богов , но выполнял функции культурного героя , созидателя и исследователя , исподволь направляющего народы к их далёкой цели . он выполняет и связующую , медиаторную роль между различными мирами : в песне `` воронова ворожба одина '' всеотец отправляет его в качестве посла к великанше модгуд , чтобы узнать о судьбе исчезнувшей богини идунн , хранительницы молодильных яблок , даровавших бессмертие богам . и всё же хеймдалль является в первую очередь защитником , хранителем духовного наследия и священной крепости асгарда , а также душой и олицетворением рыцарства , возникшего в более отдалённую эпоху . он тесно связан с мардёлл ( одно из имён фрейи ) и когда локи крадёт украшение фрейи брисингамен , он преследует злодея в виде тучи и в облике белого медведя , настигает его в форме тюленя и бьётся с похитителем , вынуждая отдать драгоценность . хеймдалль - белый бог , верный и честный ас , питает глубокую неприязнь к коварному и лукавому локи , поэтому во времена рагнарёка , согласно прорицанию вёльвы , им суждено убить друг друга . однако до той поры благородный сын одина не оставит своих детей , род ярла , белое человечество , отбирая достойных среди них и пропуская их в небесный чертог . по словам варга викернеса , `` хеймдалль даёт эйнхериям их золото жизни - личный смысл жизни , индивидуальное жизненное задание '' . это это и есть то самое сокровище , поиски которого приведут ищущего его к другому концу радуги , в обитель белого аса .\n",

      "серьезная информация , которая подается в « несерьезных » формах . скрытое влияние в кино , литературе , ток-шоу reconquista подавать нужную информацию для лучшего ее восприятия выгоднее без откровенного навязывания . « легкие » формы убеждения присущие фильмам и литературе . когда индивидуум не задумывается о том , что за просмотром невинной киноленты , ток-шоу или при чтении книги он подвергается влиянию . в качестве примера можно взять американскую мифологию , которая практически создана кинематографом . в последнее время , благодаря появлению новых сериалов , новых героев и новой идеологии , картина мира американцев меняется , а вместе с ними меняется и наша картина мира через заимствование их кинематографа и нехватки собственных фильмов . сценарии популярных сериалов часто являются закупленными из-за рубежа или транслируются сами сериалы с переводом . будучи коммерческим искусством , кинематограф обязан подстраиваться под настроение массовой аудитории . благодаря кино можно проанализировать как национальные особенности , так и их изменения в течение отрезка времени . именно с помощью кино и литературы можно осуществлять эффективную пропаганду тех или иных идей . сценарии фильмов также могут формировать негативное отношение к той или иной национальности . массовая коммуникация включает в себя собственные мифы , которые формируют и поддерживают модель мира через литературу и кинофильмы . но базовой будет оставаться массовая культура потому что она : - охватывает все население , а не какие-то его сегменты - имеет базис динамику , а не консерватизм - « привлекает » , как и другая развлекательная сфера , поэтому легче распространяется - направлена на развлекательность , ее смыслы не нарываются на то критическое сопротивление , которое существует в других сферах . кино и литература имеют ярко выраженную тенденцию к изменениям и подстройке к потребностям массовой аудитории , позволяет заинтересовывать ее , находясь в постоянной динамике . через кинофильмы формируются виртуальные миры . с их помощью создается новая идеология в мире реальном , создавая новые модели поведения , новых героев и новый образ жизни . это информационная модель поведения , которая подсознательно влияет на конкретного человека . самоидентификацию не может дать зарубежное кино , только национальное . доминирование чужого кинематографа влияет на мысли , формирование моделей поведения людей , их отношение к собственной стране . доминирование заимствованных кинопродуктов меняет отношение к стране в целом . существует конфликт нарративов , что формирует имидж той или иной страны перед другими государствами . политические ток-шоу также стали нести больше функцию развлекательную , чем информационную . на первый план теперь вышли не ценность фактов , а громкость голоса оппонентов , а иногда и физическая сила . политическая мифология может содержаться где угодно : в кинематографе , литературе ( не исключением является даже литература детская ) . мифами наполнена литература , в которой всегда реальный авторский текст , авторский замысел и тот смысл менялись после ознакомления с текстом читателя , вложения его понимание прочитанного . то же касается и просмотра фильмов . так что для самоидентификации народа , построение собственных мифов просто необходимо создавать собственные качественные продукты , содержащие в себе нужные установки .\n",

      "sehr empfehlenswerter aktionsplan für nationalistische gruppen seaforth aktivismus in österreich - erste schritte zum freien widerstand vor ort -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- vorwort : dieser text richtet sich in erster linie an jene leute die zwar mit dem herzen schon lange bei uns und unserer sache sind aber unsere überzeugung und unsere ansichten noch nicht auf die straße getragen haben . vorweg , keine gruppe ist am anfang zu klein und es ist noch nicht einmal zu wenig wenn man gänzlich alleine anfängt ! viele der größten und bedeutendsten gruppen wurden von nur zwei oder drei menschen gegründet . vergiss darum nie , dass du ganz alleine in wenigen stunden hunderte flugblätter an hunderte von menschen verteilen kannst wobei viele bürger vielleicht zum ersten mal mit sachlichen argumenten unserer bewegung konfrontiert werden . ein netz von aktivisten , so klein dieses auch sein mag , das sich für gezielte aktionen und kampagnen zusammenschließt ist in vielen städten eine treibende kraft der bewegung und schon so manchem politischem gegner zum verhängnis geworden ! wenn auch du eine aktionsgruppe gründen möchtest , dann solltest du dir einmal sachlich überlegen wer von deinen freunden und bekannten da mitmachen würde , wer in frage kommt unsere sache positiv zu unterstützen und wer die kompetenz und den kampfgeist dazu hat unsere bewegung zu stärken . danach solltest du ein paar treffen organisieren , dort könnt ihr euch grundsätzliches überlegen . für den fall das ihr keine privaten räumlichkeiten besitzt , ein lokal das einen hinterraum anbietet findet sich in jedem kleinen dorf , durch ein gut organisiertes treffen ist der grundstein für eine entspannte atmosphäre gelegt ! normalerweise braucht es ein paar treffen , um sich auf eine linie und die grundlegenden schwerpunkte eurer gruppe zu einigen , vergesst dabei nie keine angriffsfläche zu bieten , es ist nämlich völlig sinnlos sich strahlende namen zu geben um den schein einer großen organisation zu imitieren oder sich eine symbolik und auftreten zuzulegen das nur der systempresse hilft aber den normalen jugendlichen oder bürger sofort abschreckt . macht euch auch klar wer euer gegner ist und heuchelt in eurem erscheinungsbild nichts vor das nicht der wahrheit entspricht , republikgeier und dumpfer austropatriotismus sind die aushängeschilder des systems welches wir ändern wollen , nicht die unseren . am anfang sollten die meisten gruppen noch nicht viel riskieren , verzichtet am anfang auch lieber auf medienwirksame aktionen oder eure gruppe wird schneller unter dem druck von polizei , staatssicherheitsbeamten und der öffentlichen ausgrenzung zugrunde gehen als sie entstanden ist , auch verwaltungsstrafen für ungenehmigte aktionen kosten geld und helfen euch und vor allem unserer sache nicht . viel wirkungsvoller sind für den anfang kleine legale und seriöse aktionen vor ort , je nach dem wie weit ihr gehen wollt müsst ihr euch aber auch darüber im klaren sein das ihr damit in das gespräch kommen werdet , sollte euch das in eurer heimatstadt unangenehm sein oder euch und eurer familie schaden dann tretet in einer nachbarstadt in aktion , solltet ihr keine fahrmöglichkeiten haben nutzt öffentliche verkehrssysteme für hin und rückfahrt . haltet euch vor augen . österreich ist bevölkert von kleinbürgerlichen menschen , es mag euch zwar vielleicht grandios vorkommen weltbewegende themen aufzugreifen , vergesst aber nie das die meisten bürger gerne einmal den kopf schütteln was irgendwo auf der welt oder europaweit passiert doch schon alleine durch die fehlende möglichkeit wirklich etwas dagegen zu tun die gedanken diesbezüglich schnell wieder abstreifen , versucht also inhaltlich die situation direkt vor ort aufzugreifen und diese mit themen höherer natur zu verbinden . so könnt ihr fehlenden weitblick überbrücken und die bürger dazu bringen sich ernsthaft mit eurer sache auseinanderzusetzen . der kampf um die köpfe ist knochenarbeit , flugblätter zu verteilen oder mit wildfremden leuten zu diskutieren ist manchen zu viel mühe , aber nichtsdestotrotz gibt es kaum eine einfachere art auf unsere sache aufmerksam zu machen und für unsere bewegung zu werben . für bis zu zwei personen , die nur zettel verteilen und plakate halten brauchst du keine anmeldung . zu zweit könnt ihr theoretisch spontan mit ein paar flugblättern eine miniatur-demo starten wo ihr wollt , sollte aber doch jemand die polizei verständigen folgt deren anweisungen , politische aktivisten sind in österreich vogelfrei , versucht daher gar nicht auf gesetzeslagen zu beharren , die folgen bei solchem verhalten enden immer bei empfindlichen geldstrafen die wesentlich besser in eure gruppe investiert werden könnten . macht euch klar wen ihr ansprechen werdet , denn niemand kann sich sein publikum aussuchen . mit flugblättern erreichst du im prinzip 3 gruppen von leuten : 1 ) leute , die es gar nicht interessiert und die auch kaum ihre lieb gewonnenen ansichten verwerfen werden . diese gruppe stellt den größten teil dar . diese leute erfahren aber zumindest , dass es eine bewegung wie die unsere gibt und dass sich menschen auch dafür einsetzen und aktiv daran mitarbeiten . obwohl diese gruppe alles andere als offen für unsere botschaft ist , werden unsere anliegen zumindest zu themen die mit der zeit immer alltäglicher für sie werden . so werden unsere bewegung und unsere inhalte immer mehr zum teil der politischen landschaft , es entstehen soziologische und politische analysen über eine wachsende bewegung . 2 ) menschen , die noch nie oder kaum vernünftiges zum thema volk , nation und den problemen dieser zeit gehört haben . diese leute sind offen für dieses thema und nehmen die informationen gerne auf oder hören zum ersten mal davon und beginnen sich kritisch damit auseinander zu setzen . die saat für eine spätere politische anteilname wurde gelegt . diese leute beginnen vielleicht sogar in folge diskussionen mit bekannten und verwandten um offene fragen zu klären , oder wollen sich weiter informieren . 3 ) die kleinste gruppe sind diejenigen , die sich schon mit unserer bewegung auseinander gesetzt haben und jetzt den anstoß bekommen ihre ansichten aktiv zu ändern . diesen leuten kannst du praktische ratschläge geben , letzte unklarheiten erhellen oder bedenken aus dem weg räumen . manches mal werden sich sogar leute melden , die bei euch mitarbeiten möchten , weißt niemanden ab , aber überfordert auch niemanden . flugblätter sind schnell hergestellt . zu diesem zweck kannst du entweder fertige flugblätter übernehmen und den namen eurer gruppe darunter setzen ( aber achtung , nicht alle gruppen sind einverstanden damit ) , oder du kannst von einigen flugblättern selbst das beste zusammenschreiben , so dass euer eigenes flugblatt entsteht . wie so oft ist es auch in diesem segment politischer arbeit sehr nützlich die technische möglichkeit zu haben um flugblätter billig kopieren oder drucken zu lassen . vergesst nie auf das flugblatt auch ein impressum zu schreiben , sonst setzt es beim ersten mal verwaltungsstrafen um die 100 euro und bei anderen druckwerken wie broschüren , zeitschriften oder gar büchern wesentlich härtere strafen . eine gültige adresse und euer gruppennamen reichen im prinzip , zusätzlich der name einer person von euch wäre aber fast besser . das impressum dient der polizei in erster linie dazu , eine stelle zu haben , an die sie sich wenden kann , wenn einmal etwas schief läuft , sich also irgend wer über eine spontane demo beschwert , oder klagen wegen unterlassung oder übler nachrede drohen , achtet daher immer darauf das der inhalt eurer flugblätter auch legal ist , vermeidet anspielungen und den wortgebrauch vergangener zeiten , stellt einen eindeutigen , faktischen und klaren inhalt zusammen der unanfechtbar ist und keine auslegung zu lässt welche euch schaden könnte ! wenn ihr drei bis vier leute zusammen habt , dann können zwei ein transparent halten , während die anderen flugblätter verteilen . viele leute , die keine flugblätter nehmen , lesen dann zumindest das transparent . da ein transparent auffälliger ist als einfach ein paar leute , die flugblätter verteilen solltest du auf dieses einfache mittel möglichst viele menschen mit deinem anliegen zu erreichen nicht verzichten . auch das rufen von slogans hat eine erstaunliche wirkung auf die passanten und vor allem auf jugendliche , menschen auf der anderen straßenseite welche euren protest vermutlich gar nicht bemerkt hätten , werden aufmerksam und lesen euer transparent oder kommen extra , um sich ein flugblatt zu holen , allerdings werden dadurch auch viele schüchterne menschen abgeschreckt , setzt dieses mittel also nur von zeit zu zeit ein und achtet darauf das eure lockmittel nicht in ruhestörung ausarten oder ihr seit gut und gerne 80 bis 100 euro an vater staat los und müsst eure aktion wohl oder übel abbrechen . die politischen gegner zeigen sich oft unangenehm berührt , da solche `` lautstarken '' proteste für diese ein schlag in die gutmenschliche fratze sind , manche personen werden auch versuchen euch kritisch in debatten zu verwickeln , blockt diese aber ab , diese monologe von unbelehrbaren personen sollen in den meisten fällen nur dazu dienen euch zu provozieren und andere menschen durch eine streitsituation vertreiben die sich interessiert zeigen würden . in den allerwenigsten fällen könnte es auch passieren dass ihr tätlich angegriffen werdet , wehrt euch dann in angemessener form , denn ihr habt alles recht eure meinung in eurem land kund zu tun und das darf euch niemand streitig machen . feigheit bestraft das leben , niemand muss sich für unsere bewegung schämen oder sich verstecken , insofern ihr euch korrekt verhalten habt könnt ihr auch die polizei einschalten um euch von solchen randalierern und chaoten zu befreien , schreibt euch daher immer die telefonnummer der polizei vor ort für den notfall heraus ! .\n",

      "kotromanic was been serbian kingdom dinasty : bosna do pojave prvih kotromanića srpska bosna i srpska dinastija kotromanic ! smatra se da se ime bosna po prvi put javilo u jednom spisu konstantina porfirogenita ( sredina x veka ) i to na onom mestu gde o u opisu srbije navodi : `` u krtenoj srbiji jesu ovi naseljeni gradovi : destinikom , cernauvski , megiretus , dresnik , salines , a u kraju bosni katera i desnik '' . u to doba bosna se nije smatrala dravom već samo delom rake kojom je tada vladao knez časlav . o bosni su i inače veoma siromani podaci i do sredine x veka o njoj se ne zna bilo ta pouzdanije . nazire se tek da je njome upravljao ban , a ova titula ima verovatno avarsko poreklo . `` ponekad je vladao celom bosnom samo jedan vladar , a ponekad je vlast bila podeljena na mnogo vladara od kojih je svako vladao za sebe '' ( mavro orbin ) . nakon časlavljeve smrti , počele su smutnje u rakoj , to je bosna iskoristila i osamostalila se . no , to nije dugo trajalo , tek do 968. godine kada hrvatski kralj mihailo kreimir i udari na bosnu i zauzme celu zemlju . bosanski ban je pobegao u ugarsku , a bosna je postala sastavni deo hrvatske drave . ni hrvatska vlast nije dugo trajala , već je uskoro smenjuje vizantija . nakon smrti vizantijskog cara vasilija ( 1025 . ) naglo opada moć carstva to koriste bosna , duklja i raka i osamostaljuju se . u vremenu između 1082-1085. godine dukljanski kralj bodin uspeva da sve te tri drave stavi pod svoju kontrolu . u bosni je postavio za bana nekog stefana , dok je u raku postavio vukana . ni ovo jedinstvo nije dugo trajalo , tek do bodinove smrti ( 1102. godine ) . to je bilo poslednji put da je bosna bila u sastavu rake drave i od tada ona vodi svoj samostalni ivot koji će biti često u sukobu sa onim koji se vodio u rakoj . iste te godine kada je umro bodin ( 1102 . ) , pala je i hrvatska pod ugarsku vlast . nedugo potom uzeli su ugari i bosnu , a kralj bela ii je na saboru u ostrogonu ( 1139 . ) svome mlađem sinu ladislavu ( tada maloletnom ) dodelio bosnu . iz nekog teko objanjivog razloga ugari bosnu tada nazivaju ramom , a ugarski kralj nosi naziv `` kralj ugarske , dalmacije , hrvatske i rame '' . nejasan je razlog tome , budući da je rama bila tek deo bosne , a sasvim je izvesno da su ugari drali celu bosnu pod svojom vlaću . bosnom su i do tada upravljali banovi , a tako je bilo i za vreme ugarske vladavine . ko su oni bili ostaje tajna , a prvi o kojem se neto vie zna jeste ban borić . za celo vreme svoje vladavine bio je verni ugarski vazal i u okviru ugarske vojske ratovao je protiv vizantije pod braničevom . neku istaknutu ulogu u ovom ratu nije odigrao pa ni po tome nije ostao upamćen . nakon te kratkotrajne ratne avanture ban borić se umeao u dinastičke borbe u ugarskoj , ali na slabijoj strani to ga je dovelo u sukob sa ugarskim kraljem . rezultat te nesmotrenosti bilo je njegovo smenjivanje . odmah potom bosna je pala opet pod vizantiju ( 1166 . ) i pod njenom vlaću bila sve do smrti cara manojla i komnena ( 1180. ) . ostaje otvoreno pitanje da li je odmah nakon pada bosne pod vizantiju ( 1166 . ) bansku čast zauzeo kulin ban . ako je tako , odnosno ako je vizantija bila ta koja ga je postavila na bansku čast , on je bio bez sumnje njen tićenik . ovo je samo mogućnost poto nije sigurno u koje je vreme kulin stvarno doao na vlast , tako da nije bez osnove misliti da je na vlast doao kasnije budući da se po prvi put spominje tek od 1180. godine . u to vreme u rakoj već due vreme vlada veliki upan stefan nemanja koji je bio pokoran vizantiji ne iz ubeđenja , već iz nude . međutim , odmah nakon smrti vizantijskog cara manojla i , udrueni raani , ugari i bosanci odluče da iskoriste trenutne smutnje oko novoga cara i provaljuju na vizantijsku teritoriju . to je inače bilo jedino ratno dejstvo kulin bana jer je on izbegavao vojne sukobe , oslanjajući se uglavnom na ono to moe da se postigne politikom . smrt cara manojla donela je bosni oslobođenje od vizantije , međutim ne za dugo jer odmah potom ponovo dolazi pod ugarsku vlast . sada je kulin ban vazal ugarskog kralja bele iii . kulin ban je ostao u dobroj uspomeni kod naroda , a to nije čudno budući da se radilo o veoma spretnom političaru koji je umeo da bude sa svima u dobrim odnosima . `` u njegovo vreme bilo je ( kau ) u izobilju svega blaga bojega , tako da i danas običan puk , kad ima velikog obilja , obično kae : vratila su se vremena kulina bana '' ( mavro orbin ) . sa porodicom velikog upana stefana nemanje se čak i orodio budući da se kulinova sestra udala za nemanjinog brata miroslava . dok je u bosni , zahvaljujući kulinu , vladao mir u rakoj se počinjale smutnje . tokom 1196. godine sa prestola u rakoj se povukao stefan nemanja , a tokom 1200. godine je i umro . stefan nemanja je ostavio raku na vladanje mlađem sinu stefanu , ali to stariji sin vukan nije nikako mogao da pretrpi budući da je on bio stariji i da je po dotadanjim pravilima raka trebala pripasti njemu . potajna netrpeljivost je uskoro prerasla u krvavi građanski rat , a vukan je krenuo na brata stefana . `` posle prestavljenja svetoga starca , dizae se na sve načine nanoseći neprijateljstvo i zlo bratu svojemu stefanu samodrcu , i uzimajući u pomoć mnoge inoplemene narode , .. '' ( teodosije ) . dok se sve to deavalo u rakoj , kulin ban je imao problema sa bogumilskom jeresi . ta je verska sekta uzela tolikog maha u bosni da se papa jedno vreme razmiljao da pokrene krstaki rat i da bogumile istrebi . moguće da ta jeres ne bi imala toliku snagu da joj vladari bosne nisu pruali sasvim otvorenu podrku , a to nikako nije moglo ostati papi nepoznato . `` doznali smo da je nedavno splitski nadbiskup proterao iz splita i trogira veći broj patarena , a da je plemeniti mu kulin ban bosanski dao onim grenicima ne samo sigurno sklonite , nego i javnu pomoć i izloio njihovoj zloći svoju zemlju i sebe samoga , pa ih je častio kao katolike , čak i vie nego katolike , nazivajući ih hrićanima '' , pie papa ugarskom kralju emeriku . uz to mu naređuje da se obrati kulinu i da ovaj iz bosne protera bogumile , a u suprotnom , ako kulin ne poslua , da pokrene vojsku na bosnu . kulin je do kraja uspeo da ovaj problem rei na sebi svojstven način . tokom 1203. godine papska komisija je izvrila uvid u situaciju i na neki način kulin je uspeo da se opravda , to je za trenutak skinulo opasnost od bosne . nedugo potom kulin je i umro . kulina je nasledio neki stefan za koga postoje samo maglovite pretpostavke da je kulinov sin . od samoga početka stefan je imao dobre odnose sa ugarskim dvorom i tamo je često boravio . u bosni nije bio mnogo omiljen budući da je progonio bogumile , to govori da se na vlasti odravao isključivo zahvaljujući ugarskoj pomoći . u vreme njegovo banovanja u rakoj se mnogo toga desilo . najpre je vukan uspeo da svrgne sa upanskog prestola svoga brata stefana , ali samo za kratko . veoma brzo , uspeo je stefan ( prvovenčani ) da se povrati na presto i da se 1217. godine okruni kraljevskom krunom . dok se sve to deavalo , u bosni su bogumili toliko ojačali da je papa odlučio da ovaj put stvarno pokrene krstaki rat i da tu jeres konačno iskoreni . u tom okviru pokrenuo je veoma ivu diplomatsku aktivnost . za sve to vreme o banu stefanu nema nigde nikakvih pomena , a papa ga nigde niti hvali niti kudi . po svemu sudeći bio je gorljivi katolik , ali u bosni se njegova reč nije mnogo sluala . to je dovelo do toga da bude u bosni omrznut i da negde oko 1332. godine ( ili dve do tri godine kasnije ) bude svrgnut sa vlasti . povukao se u usoru kod svoga sina , kneza sibislava , gde je , najkasnije do 1336. godine , umro . bana stefana nasledio je ( po svemu sudeći nasilno ) ban matej ninoslav . njega su na bansku čast uzdigli bogumili , to je pomalo čudno budući da je u prvo vreme ban ninoslav ( dok jo nije postao ban ) bio protivnik bogumila , verni ugarski vazal i gorljivi katolik . papa mu pie ljubazna pisma i obraća mu se sa `` grleći te iskrenom ljubavi , tvoju osobu i tvoju zemlju bosnu primamo pod zatitu sv . petra i nau sa svim imanjima , koje sada pravedno dri , i utvrđujemo te zatitom ovoga pisma te strogo zabranjujemo , da se bilo ko usudi da te uznemirava , dok ostane u katoličkoj veri ... itd . '' tada počinje da se spominje i ninoslavov rođak prijezda koji se navodno ponovo iz jeresi vratio u katoličku veru . kako se prijezdi nije mnogo verovalo to je morao da dominikancima ostavi svoga sina kao zalogu svoje iskrene namere da ostane u katoličkoj veri . budući da se prijezda isticao progonima bogumila to je izgledalo da je postao iskreni katolik , pa je papa naredio dominikancima da mu vrate sina . u tom momentu on jo uvek nije ličnost većeg formata , ali će kasnija istorija da ga upozna kao verovatnog rodonačelnika porodice kotromanić . ban ninoslav je bio jedno vreme verni ugarski vazal , ali na ugarskom dvoru ga nisu ozbiljno shvatali smatrajući ga tek nekim od ugarskih dravnih slubenika . takva poniavajuća uloga je doivela svoj vrhunac kada je ugarski kralj andrija , kao da ne postoji ban ninoslav , poklonio bosnu hercegu kolomanu ( 1234. ) . time je dovedena samostalnost bosne u pitanje , ali i vlast bana ninoslava . istovremeno , to je ohrabrilo i kneza sibislava ( sina umrlog bana stefana ) da počne da navaljuje na one delove bosne kojima je vladao ninoslav , pokuavajući time da uzme za sebe bansku čast . da se stvar jo vie zaplete pobrinula se crkva koja se neprestano nosila sa bogumilima , ali uz veoma slabe rezultate . eleći da nekako slomi tu jeres papa je svrgnuo dotadanjeg bosanskog biskupa ( bogumila po svemu sudeći ) , a na njegovo mesto je imenovao pripadnika dominikanskog reda , nemca johana . u bosni je buknulo otvoreno nezadovoljstvo jer niko nije hteo nemca za biskupa . to je bilo sasvim dovoljno da i papa grgur ix izgubi strpljenje i da naredi da 1234. godine započne krstaki rat . kako je papa smatrao bana ninoslava za glavnog krivca svih ovih događaja , jer se ban nije dovoljno trudio da iskoreni jeres , a da bi mu jo vie napakostio , potvrdi darovnicu ugarskog kralja andrije po kojoj bosna pripada hercegu kolomanu ( 1235. ) . rat je trajao skoro pet godina i krstai su uskoro preplavili bosnu . u samome početku bosanci su se uspeno branili , a da je rat bio iscrpljujući vidi se iz toga to je novom biskupu johanu bilo svega dosta u tolikoj meri da je traio od pape da ga razrei nove dunosti . papa ga je pokuao ubediti piući mu : `` ako te tekoće ratne pritiću , ljubav prema bogu , prema tvojoj dui i poverenoj ti crkvi trae od tebe , da do smrti ne bei od tvoje teke slube . stoga te savetujemo , da odustane od molbe za ostavku i ne ostavi upravu tvoje crkve , nego da na jeretike i ostale protivnike katoličke vere muki i jakom rukom udari '' . izgledalo je kao da je cela bosna protiv pape . od bosanskih velikaa jedino je usorski knez sibislav bio uz krstae i zbog toga ga papa naziva ljiljanom među trnjem . u svakom slučaju knez sibislav nije protiv bana ninoslava ratovao zbog verskog uverenja ( poto je i tada , a i kasnije ninoslav bio katolik , a nikada bogumil ) već isključivo zbog toga to je eleo za sebe bansku čast . ban ninoslav je pruao od samoga početka otpor , ali pred brojnijim krstaima nije se mogao odrati pa se sklonio negde u blizini dubrovnika gde se sa jednog dela teritorije i dalje branio . u to vreme ( 1240 . ) imao je kontakata sa dubrovnikom i sa njima je sklapao ugovore , to moe da znači da je jo uvek bio dovoljno moćan da bi ga dubrovnik uvaavao . uporan otpor mu se isplatio kada da su tokom 1241. godine tatari provalili u ugarsku i na reci aj strano potukli ugarsku vojsku . između ostalih tu je poginuo i bosanski duman , herceg koloman . kako je ugarski kralj bela iv beao ispred tatara , koloman je bio mrtav , to je ban ninoslav iskoristio povoljnu priliku i povratio celokupnu bosnu . to mu nije bilo dovoljno pa se počeo strano svetiti svima onima koji su u proteklom ratu pruali ugarima pomoć . misleći da ni to nije dovoljno pakosti prema ugarskom kralju beli iv , ban ninoslav se umeao i u sukob splita i trogira , a na strani splita koji se pobunio protiv kralja bele iv . ovaj rat je , uglavnom zahvaljujući ninoslavljevoj vojsci , zavren uspeno za split , ali ugarski kralj bela iv je sve to smatrao veleizdajom . stoga je 1244. godine pokrenuo dve armije , jednu na split , a drugu na ninoslava . koliko je ratnih dejstava bilo , ne zna se , ali ostaje činjenica da su i split i ban ninoslav odmah klonuli te sklopili mir sa ugarskom . i pored svega bogumilstvo se nikako nije moglo iskoreniti iz bosne , to je navelo ugarskog kralja belu iv i kaločkog nadbiskupa da ponovo zatrae od pape inoćentija iv dozvolu za pokretanje novog krstakog rata . ovaj put situacija je bilo ozbiljna kao nikada do tada . to je osetio i ban ninoslav pa se stoga pismima počeo direktno obraćati papi ubeđujući ga da je i dalje revni katolik i da nikada nije bio bogumil . po svemu sudeći to je bila i istina , a to su papi potvrdile i komisije koje je slao u bosnu . `` kako smo doznali , nije plemeniti gospodin ninoslav , ban bosanski , odstupio od prave vere , nego ivi kao katolik i opsluuje hrićanske propise , iako je nekada u nevolji dobio pomoć i naklonost jeretika protiv svojih neprijatelja . poto smo po nekim verodostojnim pismima , iako starim , dobili pohvalne potvrde o čistoći njegove vere , naređujemo ti , da dobro upamti , da se nadasve mora imati pred očima i postići spas due , da ne ustane protiv spomenutog bana i njegove zemlje , posebno sada ... '' , pie papa kaločkom nadbiskupu ( 1248. ) . time je za bosnu skinuta opasnost od novog ugarskog pohoda . sve to moglo bi se uslovno nazvati pobedom bana ninoslava budući da vie nije uznemiravan . ostatak svoga ivota on je proveo baveći se uglavnom unutranjim stvarima u bosni . sa susednom rakom nikada nije bio u dobrim odnosima , a to se posebno vidi iz ugovora koje je sklapao u dva navrata sa dubrovnikom ( 1240. i 1249. ) . u njima se on obavezuje da će pomoći dubrovnik `` ako se razratite s kraljem rakim , da vas ne dam ni va dobitek , .. '' . u vreme sklapanja ovih ugovora u rakoj je vladao kralj stefan vladislav i ( ugovor iz 1240 . ) i kralj stefan uro i ( ugovor iz 1249. ) . nedugo nakon sklapanja ovoga drugog ugovora ( 1249 . ) umro je i ban ninoslav . 2 . prvi kotromanići nakon smrti bana ninoslava počele su u bosni smutnje oko njegovog nasleđa . sam ninoslav je iza sebe ostavio dovoljno potomaka i rođaka , to daljih to bliih , da bi se između njih mogao izabrati dostojan naslednik . međutim , sada su se tu pojavile različite aspiracije . bogumili su hteli da bosnu preuzme neko ko će njima biti naklonjen , dok su ugari eleli za bana nekoga iz njihove interesne sfere . na kraju je u toj zbrci pobedu odneo ugarski kralj bela iv uspevi da naturi svoga kandidata . bio je to dalji ninoslavov rođak prijezda o kojem je već bilo govora . on je izgleda jedno vreme bio bogumil , ali se kasnije povratio u katoličku veru i bio čak jedan od revnijih progonitelja jeresi u bosni . kako mu je sin bio talac kod dominikanskih fratara , to se moe posredno izvući zaključak da njegovo ponovno pokatoličavanje nije bili toliko dobrovoljno koliko prisilno . jo u vreme krstakih ratova po bosni u vremenu između 1234-1239. godine pojavljuje se prijezda sa titulom bosanskog bana . to postavlja neka pitanja . naime , u vremenu kada je bosna pala pod vlast hercega kolomana , a kako je ban ninoslav izbegao , to se bosna smatrala zemljom bez vladara . moguće da je u to vreme koloman za bana postavio svoga čoveka , a to je bio upravo prijezda . kratko je trajalo njegovo prvo banovanje , jedva dve godine , jer se ninoslav , nakon ugarske katastrofe na reci aj , vratio u bosnu . kako se on tada strano svetio ugarskim pristalicama to je sigurno i sam prijezda bio u smrtnoj opasnosti , pa je verovatno izbegao u ugarsku . ovo drugo ustoličenje prijezde za bana bosne nije prolo bez trzavica . ninoslavovi sinovi , smatrajući da banska čast pripada njima , pruili su otpor koji je bio toliko jak da je kralj bela iv morao slati vojsku koja bi pomogla prijezdi da uzme vlast . da je bilo jakog otpora vidljivo je iz pisama koje je kralj bela iv slao papi i u kojima se naveliko ali da ga neprijatelji pritiskaju sa svih strana . no , na kraju je pobuna savladana , a prijezda je preuzeo vlast . osim bosne , tada je savladan i hum ( 1254. ) . nakon svega ugarski kralj odluči da bosnu podeli na dva dela . od porečja gornjega vrbasa i bosne formirao je banovinu bosnu gde su vladali banovi iz roda biveg bana ninoslava . drugi deo bosne je sačinjen od usore i soli gde je ugarski kralj direktno imenovao banove . to je bilo vreme formiranja banovina koje su trebale da tite granice ugarske . kralj bela iv je tada pokuao i da već postojeću mačvansku banovinu ojača time to ju je nakon smrti svoga zeta rostislava , koji je njome do tada upravljao , uzdigao na rang hercegovine ( vojvodine ) i njenom vladaru omogućio irenje uticaja na usoru i soli , a moguće čak i na bosnu . mačvanska banovina je time postala veoma jaka i njenim gospodarima je omogućavala da u narednim periodima gospodare bosnom , a ponekad sremom i braničevom . da je bila jaka vidi se iz toga to je herceg bela ( unuk kralja bele iv ) , kao gospodar mačvanske banovine , uspeo da 1268. godine slomi napad rakog kralja stefana uroa i i da ga čak u tim sukobima i zarobi . tokom 1270. godine umro je ugarski kralj bela iv , a nasledio ga je sin stevan v. u ratovima koje je tada vodio novi ugarski kralj poginuo je i mačvanski vojvoda bela ( 1272 . ) , a nedugo zatim umre i sam kralj stevan v. nasledio ga je desetogodinji sin ladislav iv kumanac ( 1272-1290 . ) , dok je regenstvo vrila kraljica-majka elizabeta . u to vreme kao bosanski ban spominje se neki ugarski velika stefan . to je bila pomalo čudna situacija budući da je i prijezda nosio istu titulu , ali po svemu sudeći tu vlast nije i vrio na teritoriji cele bosne i na neki način ta mu je titula bila samo `` prazna '' počast bez potpune sadrine . titulu bosanskog bana dobijali su kasnije jo neki ugarski velikai , a među njima i severinski ban , inače dvorski rizničar ( ban ugrin ) . ban prijezda se oko 1287. godine povukao sa vlasti i na svom imanju u zemljeniku provodio je svoje poslednje dane . ne zna se ta je moglo biti uzrokom njegovog povlačenja : starost ili je bio prisiljen ? imao je tri sina : prijezdu ii , stjepana i vuka . jedinu ćerku katarinu udao je u hrvatsku kuću babonića . vlast u bosni su podelila njegova dva sina i to tako da je stjepan vladao u istočnom delu bosne dok je prijezda ii vladao u zapadnom delu . po svemu sudeći bansku su čast delili , a to se vidi iz jednog papinog pisma gde se on obraća `` plemenitim muevima stjepanu i prijezdi , banovima bosne '' . u ugarskoj su se tada deavala velika unutranja previranja koja su imala kasnijeg odraza i na bosnu . kralj ladislav iv je odjednom počeo da vri reorganizaciju u dravi pa je tako mačvu , usoru i soli poverio svojoj majci elizabeti ( jelisaveti ) nazivajući je `` vojvotkinjom mačvansko-bosanskom '' ( 1280. ) . u to vreme ponovo se pojavio problem bogumila u bosni , ali kako kralj nije imao mnogo volje da se njima bavi to se sve zavrilo na dopisivanju sa papom . tokom 1284. godine kralj ladislav iv oduzima majci elizabeti upravu nad mačvanskom banovinom i preputa je muu svoje sestre kataline , bivem rakom kralju , stefanu dragutinu . sada je eks raki kralj vladao nad mačvom sa beogradom , usorom i soli , ali i nad nekim srpskim zemljama noseći naziv `` sremski kralj '' : `` i ustavi ode u oblast drave svoje , u zemlju zvanu mačva , koju mu je dao tast njegov kralj ugarski . tamo doavi sa enom svojom blagočastivom kraljicom katelinom i sa jednim delom vlastele svoje , ... '' ( danilo drugi ) . samim tim dobio je odlučujući uticaj nad onim delom bosne kojim su vladali ban prijezde i , a kasnije i njegovi sinovi . za razliku od svojih prethodnika dragutin je bio veoma revnostan u prekrtavanju bogumila . `` mnoge od jeretika bosanske zemlje obrati u hrićansku veru i krsti ih '' ( danilo drugi ) . taj njegov rad na prekrtavanju bogumila nije bio praćen nasiljem , tako da nije poznato da ih je on progonio . `` njegovom blagodaću koja sve daje , dođe u tu zemlju da je prosveti , i da narod , koji je bio u tami i mraku neznanja , po učenju boanskoga pisma privede ka svetlosti spasonosnoga ivota '' ( danilo drugi ) . negde tokom 1291. godine preao je i sam u katoličku veru . kako su dragutin i ban prijezda i bili smotreni političari to su ubrzo uvideli da im je jedini način za opstanak zajednička saradnja . ta se saradnja ubrzo zavrila rodbinskim vezama tako to je prijezdin sin , stjepan i oenio dragutinovu ćerku jelisavetu ( 1284. ) . ova rodbinska veza sigurno da je daleko vie godila stjepanu i negoli dragutinu . zahvaljujući ovoj enidbi doao je stjepan i u najblie rodbinske veze preko tate kataline ( ćerka ugarskog kralja bele iv ) sa ugarskom kraljevskom kućom , ali i sa napuljskom kraljevskom kućom budući da je belina druga ćerka , marija , bila udata za napuljskog kralja karla ii . te su se rodbinske veze jo vie razgranale kada je druga dragutinova ćerka , uroica ( ursa ) udata za moćnog hrvatskog bana pavla i ubića . naravno , tu je bila i rodbinska veza sa kraljevskom kućom nemanjića , preko tasta dragutina . ove rodbinske veze kasnije će da imaju velikog udela u unutranjim previranjima u ugarskoj , ali i mnogo kasnije kada se tvrtko i bude krunisao za kralja . dakle , bila je tu čitava zbrka rodbinskih veza sa arpadovićima , anuvincima , ubićima i nemanjićima . to je svakako razlog za kasnije legende o poreklu porodice kotromanić i o njihovom prezimenu . najpoznatija legenda je ona koju prezentira mavro orbin . po njemu , nakon smrti kulin bana , ugarski kralj je u bosnu poslao jednog svog velikaa , poreklom nemca , koji je imao zadatak da bosnu zauzme . on se zvao kotroman , a kako je bio vet ratnik to je uspeo veoma lako da obavi zadatak . za nagradu , kralj ga je postavio bosanskim banom . `` sada , kad je umro pomenuti kulin ban , kralj koji je u to vreme bio u ugarskoj odluči , iz ranije navedenih razloga , da zauzme bosansko kraljevstvo . zbog toga je poslao s vojskom jednog svog velikaa po imenu kotroman nemac , na glasu ratnika . kad je kotroman doao u bosnu i naao je bez gospodara , lako ju je zauzeo . da bi ga za to nagradio , kralj ga je imenovao banom bosne i hteo da se njegovi potomci večno smenjuju na tom poloaju . poto je porodica kotromana tokom vremena dobila veliko potomstvo , svi su se po kotromanu nazivali kotromanići '' ( mavro orbin ) . da je legenda uhvatila korena vidi se iz nekih dubrovačkih pisama gde se ban naziva `` cotrumano goto '' . danas se misli da kotromanići nisu stranog porekla i da potiču iz neke bosanske plemićke kuće , a da je ban prijezda i tek jedan od njenih pripadnika , nikako utemeljivač ove dinastije . to delimično potvrđuje i mavro orbin kada navodi da je : `` njihova porodica gotovo uvek vladala u bosni . nekad su to bili banovi , a nekad kneevi '' . od enidbe sa dragutinovom ćerkom potpao je ban stjepan i pod njegov uticaj i mnoge stvari koje je činio bile su plod dragutinove volje . da to nije moglo uvek izaći na dobro mogao se uveriti nakon smrti ugarskog kralja ladislava 1290. godine . kako kralj iza sebe nije ostavio dece to se postavilo pitanje naslednika ugarskog prestola . veoma brzo nakon ladislavljeve smrti krunisan je za kralja njegov blizak srodnik andrija iii mlečanin . međutim , kako je imao jaku opoziciju to su odmah počele i smutnje . kao najopasniji protivnik pojavio se napuljski kralj karlo ii ( pripadnik anujske dinastije ) , mu marije , inače sestre kralja ladislava , koji je za svoga sina karla martela zatraio ugarski presto arpadovića . ova je stranka bila veoma jaka pa je na kraju papa nikola iv krunisao karla martela za ugarskog kralja . uz ovu stranu tada su pristupili i najjači hrvatski velikai , bribirski knezovi ubići . u to vreme ovu kuću su sačinjavala tri brata : pavle i , juraj i mladen . kako je dragutinova ćerka ursula ( ursa ) bila udata za pavla ubića to je sasvim razumljivo da su dragutin i zet mu , ban stjepan i kotromanić , pristupili odmah uz ovu stranku . u tim političkim igrama karlo martel im je , ne bi li ih zadrao i dalje kao pristalice , svojim poveljama razdelio dobar deo hrvatske i bosne . da li su ubići dobili uz hrvatsku i bosnu , teko je reći , ali se zna da je dragutinov sin , vladislav , dobio skoro celu slavoniju . izgledalo je da ova stranka ima velike anse , ali tada iznenada umre karlo martel ( 1295. ) . međutim , napuljska kraljica marija dođe na ideju da na ugarski presto zasedne sin karla martela koji se zvao karlo robert ( njen unuk ) . u tom njenom naumu iz sve snage ju je pomagao i papa bonifacije viii koji je čak karla roberta , tada tek dvanaestogodinjeg dečaka , proglasio za ugarskog kralja ( 1297. ) . porodica ubić , imajući pod svojom vlaću hrvatsku proirivala je svoj uticaj eleći da i bosnu podvede pod svoju vlast . početkom 1299. godine pavle ubić se naziva `` gospodarom bosne '' ( dominus bosne ) , a u skladu sa tim , svome bratu mladenu i dodelio je titulu bana bosne . od tada su oni celu bosnu drali pod svojom kontrolom izuzev jednog dela koji se naziva donji krajevi i koje je drao knez hrvatin stjepanić . kako je knez hrvatin bio odan ubićima to su oni izvrili pritisak na napuljskog kralja karla ii roberta da mu izda povelju kojom potvrđuje njegovu vladavinu . `` imajući u vidu na čistoću vernosti , a i na druge korisne i primljene slube to su knez hrvatin i njegovi sinovi i braća , rođaci plemenitih pavla , bana hrvata , a i braće njegove jurja i mladena , knezova dalmatinskih gradova , ljubljeni i verni nai , nama činili i sada jo čine u poslu kraljevstva ugarske , potvrđujemo rečenome hrvatinu , sinovima i braći njegovoj donje krajeve zemlje bosanske koje sada dre i poseduju '' . sredinom 1300. godine uspeo je pavle ubić da karla ii roberta dovede u split , a onda kroz hrvatsku u zagreb . sada se već spremao rat jer andrija iii mlečanin nije imao nameru da tek tako prepusti krunu . međutim , iz nepoznatog razloga u sred priprema za rat umre kralj andrija iii . iako je ostao bez glavnog protivnika karlo robert je imao mnotvo protivnika u ugarskoj pa je sve do 1309. godine morao da vodi borbe sa njima . dok se sve to deavalo mladen ubić je pokuavao da celokupnu bosnu stavi pod svoju kontrolu . naravno da sve ovo ban stjepan i kotromanić nije mirno posmatrao i orujem se suprotstavio ovim aspiracijama ubića . no , bio je beznadeno slabiji i do 1302. godine mladen ubić je postigao dovoljno uspeha da stavi skoro celu bosnu pod svoju kontrolu . stjepan i kotromanić ipak nije bio poraen i odravao se na jednom manjem delu bosne . u to vreme tast dragutin mu nije mogao mnogo pomoći budući da se i sam teko upleo u borbe sa svojim bratom , rakim kraljem milutinom , u borbi oko nasledstva u rakoj . upravo u tim danima zaigrao je dragutin nemanjić veliku igru pokuavajući da svoga sina vladimira progura na ugarski presto . kako je vladislav bio oenjen konstancom morosini , koja je bila u rodu sa pokojnim kraljem andrijom iii , to je i vladislav imao isto onoliko prava na ugarski presto kao i karlo robert . to je bio jo jedan razlog zbog kojeg nije mogao da pomogne svome zetu . ipak i pored toga ban stjepan i kotromanić se drao sasvim dobro , a kada se rat pretvorio u verski jer je mladen ubić nasrnuo na bogumile , ovi svi listom pređu na stranu stjepana i kotromanića . takva mladenova neopreznost kotala ga je i ivota jer ga u jednom sukobu bogumili ubiju ( 1304 ) . nasledio ga je sin mladen ii ubić , ali on nije bio ličnost formata svoga oca . tek uz pomoć vojske koju mu je poslao pavle ubić uspeo je da slomi poslednji otpor . od 1305. godine naziva se pavle ubić `` gospodarem čitave bosne '' . no ni trijumf pavla ubić ne traje dugo jer i on 1312. godine umire . već razočarani ban stjepan i kotromanić je umro neto prije 1314. godine , dakle skoro istovremeno kada i njegov ljuti protivnik . iza sebe je ostavio tri sina : stjepana , vladislava i ninoslava . u to vreme niko od njih nije boravio u bosni , budući da su se morali pred navalom ubića , ali po svemu sudeći i unutranjeg nezadovoljstva , skloniti u dubrovnik . `` kada je , dakle , posle smrti pomenutog bana stjepana njegov najstariji sin stjepan , saglasno sa svojom braćom , hteo preuzeti upravu u bosni , ustali su protiv njega svi najistaknutiji velikai toga kraljevstva i nisu ga prihvatili . na ovo ih nije navelo nita drugo sem to to su videli da su on i njegova braća veoma pametni i vezani između sebe , pa su se jako pobojali da ne bi kojim putem unitili slobodu i ukinuli zakone bosne . kad je stjepan video razjarenost velikaa , smatrao je da je u tom času najpametnije da im popusti i da se prilagodi vremenu , te da čeka da mu bog poalje neku drugu priliku da povrati očinsku dravu . zato se povukao sa svojom majkom jelisavetom u dubrovnik '' ( mavro orbin ) . za to vreme mladen ii ubić , koji se sada nazivao `` mladen , knez zadra , princip dalmacije i drugi ban bosanski '' , nikako nije uspevao da odri svoju vlast na svim onim teritorijama koje je nasledio od pavla ubića . najpre mu je iz ruku iskliznuo zadar koji se 1313. godine prepustio veneciji . to kao da je bio znak za sve nezadovoljnike da se pobune protiv njegove vladavine . u retrospektivi gledano , upravo je pad zadra bio uvod i u konačni slom moći mladena ii ubića . nekako su svi tada bili u ljutim nevoljama . dok je kuća ubića naletala na sve vie neprijatelja , kotromanići su doiveli gubitak budući da im je ban stjepan i kotromanić umro ( 1314 . ) , a umro je i njegov dotadanji stalni zatitnik `` sremski kralj '' , dragutin nemanjić . `` bi prestavljenje ovoga preblaenoga meseca marta dvadeset drugi dan , treće nedelje svete četrdesetnice u petak , u čas deveti i tako se raziđoe svako svojoj kući , slaveći i sina i sv . duha , sada i uvek i na vekove vekova . amin '' ( danilo drugi ) . smrt dragutinova je bila znak za njegovog brata , rakog kralja milutina da sa svojim trupama uđe u mačvu i zauzme je za sebe , a da dragutinovog sina vladislava baci u tamnicu . osim toga , pokuao je milutin , da zauzme i hum , ali tu je naleteo na bana mladena ii ubića , koji je takođe mislio da hum pripada njemu . to se do kraja izrodilo u oruane sukobe , a vojna dejstva su se odvijala u blizini dubrovnika . samo vojevanje je ilo jako loe po mladena ii ubića pa je do kraja morao pristati da se izmiri sa rakim kraljem milutinom i da mu svoga brata , grgura ubića , poalje kao taoca . grgura ubića i ostale taoce poslao je kralj milutin u dubrovnik i tu su oni boravili sve dok mladen ii ubić nije ispunio ono to je bilo ugovoreno .\n",

( lacht hämisch ) hey , wer kam eigentlich auf den namen `` titanic '' ? waren sie das , bruce ? ja , ganz recht . ich wollte damit die reine größe zum ausdruck bringen . größe bedeutet stabilität , luxus und vor allem stärke . haben sie schon von dr. freud gehört , mr. ismay ? was er über die männliche besessenheit was `` größe '' anbelangt , bemerkt hat , dürfte sie interessieren . - was ist nur in dich gefahren ? - entschuldigen sie mich. ich muß mich entschuldigen . sie ist eine waffe , cal ! ich hoffe , sie können mit ihr umgehen ? ich sollte von jetzt an wohl besser die abendlektüre meiner verlobten überprüfen . freud ? wer ist das ? ein passagier ? - das schiff ist ganz gut , hä ? - ja , ist auch ein irisches schiff . es ist doch englisch , oder ? nein , es wurde in irland gebaut . 15.000 iren haben es gebaut . stark wie ein fels . geschaffen von kräftigen irischen händen . ist ja mal wieder typisch ! die köter aus der ersten klasse kommen hier runter um sich auszuscheissen ! damit wird uns gezeigt , wo wir uns im gesamtbild befinden . als würden wir das vergessen . - ich bin tommy ryan . - jack dawson . - hallo - fabrizio . - hi . hast du mit deinen bildern schon was verdient ? ah , vergiß es , mein freund . an eine frau wie die kommst du nicht ran . vorher fliegen dir kleine engel aus dem hintern . rose , was war das eben für ein auftritt ? du hast versprochen , dich zu benehmen . ich sah mein leben vor mir , als ob ich es bereits hinter mir hätte . eine endlose aneinanderreihung von partys ...   \n",
