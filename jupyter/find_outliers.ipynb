( i stopped in the middle of this post to feed him and he did great . ) i hope all of the other expecting moms have the best labor experience possible . i know that it 's more important that the baby comes happy and healthy , but it still is really upsetting to have a bad experience with it . you know , you can have it explained to you a million times by everyone who 's ever given birth , but i do n't think you 'll ever know what it 's like until you experience it yourself . and i thought i should warn you , since no one really talked about this to/with me before ... you 're going to be hurting a lot afterward . i mean , a lot . not just your vagina . pushing puts so much stress on your body ... my muscles have been aching all over and they 're just barely getting back to normal now . and yes , it 's totally worth it , but you should know ! the pain just is n't all over once you have him or her . episiotomies suck , if you need to get one . i 'm still paranoid that i 've torn my stitches or opened myself back up every time i move , because it feels that way ! ouchhh . oh , also : i knew that we 're supposed to bleed a lot afterward , but my goodness , i was not expecting that amount of blood . anyway .... oh , one good thing i 've noticed is that i do n't seem to be having any trouble with depression right now . i 've had a couple of bouts of crying , but that was actually somewhat rational to me . i ca n't remember what else i was going to say ( been writing this on and off for a couple of hours ) . so , here 's another picture to make up for it .\n",

      "thanks for the tips and advice . i meant to say that earlier and i forgot .... we 'll have to try the heating pad thingy with the cradle . oh yeah , no one tells you about that . let me be the first to say , it 's multiple times worse after the second or more . you do n't get the `` afterbirth pains '' after the first one . they are different for each woman , but mine are far worse that transition contractions . i puke and double over and cry like a big baby . the whole family now braces for the aftermath ... during labor they 're all like , `` oh , she 's just having a baby . '' oh my god , i do n't know what stage i was in , i 'm assuming it was still just `` active labor '' , but i can just barely remember the worst pain i was in during labor and i ca n't imagine feeling anything worse ... i think i almost broke the hospital bed too . pushing against those handles was the only thing i could do . tim tried to get me to squeeze his hand and for some reason i just ca n't do that to anyone .... * shrug * i remember that i had my eyes closed for a lot of it between when i got the second iv drug and when i got the epidural . i 've got the world 's biggest hemorrhoid though . now it makes sense that my butthole hurts so much .... i did n't even notice that it was there until today . i thought the pain was just from the episiotomy . the contractions hurt a little bit for me when i was breast feeding and stuff , especially when i was still in the hospital , but they were n't that bad .\n",

      "i 've had to do this as well and i think i can understand how you feel . several years ago , i had to put down my best friend and for weeks , i struggled with the feelings of betrayal and feeling like a monster . my lab rowdy , had cancer and was suffering , bleeding internally and it was obvious that the end had come and it must be done . nevertheless , i still felt guilty . i made the decision , i took him to the vet , i held his head while the drugs took him away . no matter how many times people told me that it was the right and kind thing to do , i still felt like an executioner . the feelings were n't rational , but they were there for quite a while . all i can say to you , these feelings will fade with time . right now , there 's nothing anyone can say to you to make you feel better , i know that . allow yourself time to grieve , but also reflect on the good times . plant a tree in memory of your friend , or get one of those etched memory stones . that 's what i did , i know it sounds kind of stupid , but i look at that stone every day on my way out the door and remember the good times .\n",

      "he is my only child right now . i will be having another one in april but i do n't think that will get him to potty . he does n't like the potty chair either . our potty chair has the seat that will pop onto the big potty . he likes that better . he is doing better this after noon . he has went to the potty several times and both times when he needed to poop he was trying to make it to the potty . i am just trying to keep positive and explain to him that he is doing better and we will just keep working on it . i am not using diapers or pull ups , i only use them if he is taking a nap or at night and i do use them if we go out to town because he still is n't doing that great . he seems to like his big boy underwear and earlier when he went to the bathroom in them he was most uncomfortable and wanted them off . i tried the reward thing but it did n't work with him . however he does want to sleep in the big boy bed and i told him he could n't sleep in that bed until he started going to the potty like a big boy . we will see how that works .\n",

      "i 'm the same way , i 'm more afraid of being in a hospital with strangers and being told what to do . right on that your husband wants to deliver ! mine has all of ours . our midwives only do a neck sweep ( for a cord ) after the head is born . i 've never noticed the shoulders being an issue . we just wait for ours to turn on their own ( the strangest feeling ever ! ) and then the next contraction their body is born . why does she need to help for the shoulders ? has she said ? it seems like something you 'd have to be in the moment to see if it ends up being an issue . have you thought about a water birth ? they come out sooo clean ! maybe she meant the thing with the cord , i am so new to this . she has recommended that we rent an inflatable tub from a sauna dealer , because our bath tub is so short and uncomfortable for me . i think that is just going to be used for relaxation during labor . i think we have decided on doing the swat possition for the delievery . as you can probably tell i am not to sure on how this is going to go . but i can say one thing after this first one the next 4-5 should be easy .\n",

      "alex , what do your contractions feel like ? the top of my stomach hurts ( which i have read nothing about ) and i can not breathe . i feel really off . i felt fine up until about 2 hours ago ... if i keep feeling like this , i 'm thinking i need to go to the er . i 'm 1 week and 6 days away from my due date . if you go to the hospital you want to go to the labor ward , not the er . also , a big indication of whether anything is wrong is if the baby is moving ok , they generally say that you should be able to feel ten kicks in 2 hours ( some places say one hour ) , they say you are supposed to lay on your left side after eating a little bit ( or drinking something sugary , like seven up ) , with your hand under your belly . if baby is moving fine , everything is probably fine , you 're just having bh contractions , if not , get to the labor ward pronto .\n",

tuđinu i « kongregaciji za propagandu vjere » , o čemu će se opirnije govoriti u nastavku ovog malog istorijskog tiva . 2 . stefan mitrov ljubia urio je da uredi i pospremi srpske stvari u boki kao da je naslućivao da neće biti dovoljno vremena , te utiče da se stradalnicima u bokekoj pobuni obezbijedi pomoć za sruene i popaljene domove i otvori prva srpska pomorska kola u srbini novskoj stefan mitrov ljubia smatrali smo da bi savremeni čitalac bio u mnogo čemu uskraćen ili polovično informisan ako bi ga liili kratkog iskaza o jednom drugom narodnom tribunu , o pravoslavnom srbinu-bokelju , stefanu mitrovu ljubii , kome su već davno mimo njegove volje pridodali i novu naciju . e , taj uglednik i poznata istorijska ličnost o svemu je drugačije govorio i pisao od onoga to mu se danas lano umeće i atribuie . jer on je borac , bio i ostao , za narodna , posebno srpska nacionalna prava , koja su bila ukidana od tuđina i hrvata , taman kao danas to čine montanjari dokleanski . a neće to moći tako , ako smo ljubiinog soja i pameti . on je u mnogo teim uslovima djelovao smjelo , otresito i uvijek časno , počevi od 1861. godine , kada je izabran u zadarski sabor i neto kasnije u carevinsko vijeće . razumijevajući se u suptilne političke igre zagreba , usporavao je ili osporavao prisajedinjenje dalmacije hrvatskoj , jer mu je bila poznata hrvatska politika da iz javnog ivota istisne italijane i srbe , kao to je u ranijim razdobljima istisnula grke i romane , pa i mađare . i eto , konačno se genocidnom politikom ( u dva navrata ) otarasila i srba . ljubia je otvoreni protivnik dualističke ugarsko-hrvatske kraljevine i njenih pretenzija na jadranu , pa kae : « uvaiv da u pomenutim kraljevinskim odborima nije ni bilo zastupnika kraljevine dalmatinske , o sudbini kojom se raspolagalo , i da dotična nagodba nije bila nikad predloena na odobrenje sabora dalmatinskoga , ni carevinskog vijeća , kao zainteresovanih strana . uvaiv da i kad bi se mogle kraljevina hrvacka i slavonija , opozvati na storična prava , nekoliko vijeka straga , sveđe ta prava ne bi se mogla protezati nikako na zemljita dubrovačko i kotorsko , koja nijesu nikad pripadala takozvanoj trojednoj kraljevini ( hrvatska  slavonija  dalmacija ) , no su dola u vlastitost austriji u smislu čl . 93 i 94 evropskog ugovora god . 1815. kao osobine povijesno neodvisne od kraljevine dalmacije , kao to su uključivo i priznali gorepomenuti kraljevski odbornici kad ugovorie utjelovljenje dananje , a ne stare dalmacije. » episkop gerasim petranović neospornim autoritetom uticao je na odluke sabora i carevinskog vijeća , spaavajući provinciju dalmaciju , posebno boku i dubrovnik od pogibeljnog djelovanja banske hrvatske . nalazio je da će se narodni interesi uspjenije tititi pod bečkom vlaću i dalekoseno procjenjivao kakvi bi se procesi javili kad bi se kojim slučajem boka pridruila dalmaciji , a to je nedvosmisleno isticao na prčanjskoj skuptini 1848. g. urio je da uredi i pospremi srpske stvari u boki kao da je naslućivao da neće biti dovoljno vremena , te utiče da se stradalnicima u bokekoj pobuni obezbijedi pomoć za sruene i popaljene domove i otvori prva srpska pomorska kola u srbini novskoj . lično je uplivisao kod austrijskog cara da se to prije imenuje bokokotorski episkop . u istoj istorijskoj ideji i kontekstu valja razumjeti i gore pomenutu prčanjsku skuptinu bokelja , kad su ti nai preci « otpozdravili » banu jelačiću onim poznatim « ne » , iako je taj imao podrku i sa mjesta van boke , da se čovjeku digne kosa na glavi . tako će i dananji bokelji reći svakome ko ih eli odvojiti od matice . ponoviće se prčanjska skuptina ! ljubia je imao u saboru plebiscitarnu podrku hrvata za neke akcije koje je vodio , posebno kod afirmacije srpsko-hrvatskog ( narodnog ) jezika i istiskivanja italijanskog iz kola i administracije . no , kad se i to postiglo , hrvatski predstavnici se angauju da ga to prije eliminiu iz javnog ivota . proračunato i temeljito podrivaju njegov javni ugled u saboru i matičnoj boki , oslanjajući se na soj nevoljnika , odnarođene rugobe , koji su uvijek motali tuđe bandijere  naslednike onih koji su sa ratnog broda bokeke mornarice , topovskim salvama dokusurivali temelje zetske episkopije na krtoljskoj prevlaci . biskup frano ućelini i konačno , 1876. g. ostvari se dumanska namjera : ljubia je od svojih bokelja po treći put izabran u zadarski sabor , a krivoijski glavari poručie : « slijedi put kojim slijedi , na zlotvore tvoje i nae nemoj glavu obraćati. » ali u sabornici , kod ovjere mandata , biva sramotno uklonjen . tada stefan odra vatreni patriotski govor , pozdravljen burnim ovacijama . i nastavi : « ja znam to vi mene ne trpite , jer sam srb narodnoću i pravoslavnom vjerom ... » i da nije pregalaca poput ljubie , petra ćelovića , pava , rada bajkovića , save nakićenovića , laza kostića , marka cara , mirka komnenovića , ljubibratića , ućelinija , grbaljskih kneeva , bratstva trćanskih srba , patrovskog plemstva  srpskom narodu ovih krajeva zatro bi se svaki trag . 3 . neugasiva srpska iskra manastir miholjska prevlaka kod tivta iako je dokazano da prelazom u latinski obred nije se potpuno , u svakome i svuda , ugasila srpska iskra , opet je ona samo u pojedinim tinjala , kao neko nejasno osjećanje ; ali do « srpskog glasa » , to osjećanje nije se nikad do jasne svijesti razvilo , ni do kulturnog načela oličenog u čitavoj jednoj stranci kamenarović se ne osvrće na prijetnje , već se u « srpskom glasniku » br . 9 iz 1890. godine javlja poduom raspravom « o srbima katolicima » . « ne moe biti zaludan posao ocijeniti ovu pojavu , koja je zaista najznamenitija u čitavom narodnom pokretu u dalmaciji . ko ne posmatra stvar sa uskog stanovita jedne političke stranke , već sa visokog gledita kulturnog razvitka naroda , nema nikakva uzroka da zbrka narodna sa političkim pitanjima , ni da suuje kulturne pojmove u granice jednog stranačkog programa . srbi i hrvati nijesu dvije političke stranke : to bi oni tek onda bili , kad bi se podijelili na liberalce i klerikalce , na radikalce i konzervativce itd. , te kad bi primili dotični naziv , ali kao srbi i hrvati , oni su dvije kulturne struje u jednom narodu . ni hrvati ne odriču prirodnu činjenicu , da su jedan narod sa srbima ; samo tvrde , da imaju svoju zasebnu kulturu , koja ih dijeli od srba , te da je kulturni dualizam njihova tenja ; dok srbi katolici , odbijajući kulturni dualizam , kao tetan za narodni razvitak , ističu kulturno jedinstvo , koje i hrvati priznaju , kao nuan uvjet narodnom opstanku u vječitoj borbi za ivot protiv jačih kulturnih naroda koji nas opkoljavaju . i ako je « srpski glas » ( « srpski list » ) , svojim postanjem , pruio priliku katolicima liberalcima da mogu ostati slavenima , a da i ne rtvuju svoja liberalna načela , opet u tome ne stoji značaj ovoga lista i srpskog pokreta u dalmaciji , već čisto u tome , to su ovaj pokret i ovaj list udesili zgodne prilike , da se istakne vukova misao , da se izjednače katolici sa pravoslavnim srbima u narodnim tenjama , da se ostvari narodno kulturno ujedinjenje . uspjeh i plod toga pokreta u prvom redu jesu srbi katolici . i ako je dokazano da prelazom u latinski obred nije se potpuno , u svakome i svuda , ugasila srpska iskra , opet je ona samo u pojedinim tinjala , kao neko nejasno osjećanje ; ali do « srpskog lista » , to osjećanje nije se nikad do jasne svijesti razvilo , ni do kulturnog načela oličena u čitavoj jednoj stranci . do « srpskog lista » , svi mi katolici  izuzetak i ovdje potvrđuje pravilo  mislili smo , da su srbi samo pravoslavni , a da mi , katolici , ne moemo biti nego hrvati . postanjem « srpskoga lista » ta obmana ičezava . smjerno , tiho , bez druge potpore , osim one koju istina daje , progonjen od većine « srpski list » javlja katolicima da u razlici vjere ne moe biti razlike narodnosne , te obara najtvrđu pregradu to je podigao bio uticaj strane kulture između katolika i pravoslavnih . to je bilo dosta . ostalo će oboriti sami srbi katolici . dok mnogi , u namjeri da rijee srpsko-hrvatski spor , raspravljaju o arheologiji , o starim političkim granicama itd. , u dalmaciji srbi katolici rjeavaju to pitanje , ne na papiru , već praktično , i ostvaruju ga u ivotu . među katolicima srbi se naprosto vie ne broje ; ima ih po čitavoj dalmaciji , i javnih , i tajnih : ima ih po gradovima i po selima ; ima ih među činovnicima i među popovima i među fratrima ; u dubrovniku , gdje je sjedite narodne inteligencije u dalmaciji ; srbi katolici imaju čitav izborni kotar sa svojim zastupnikom . ljudi , koji su se prije nazivali hrvatima , misleći da je to naziv katoličkog slavena , sad se tome čude , kad je obznana otila , to hrvati postaju srbima . da smo mi velik , prostran narod , kao na primjer , njemci ; da smo razvili svoju narodnu kulturu do visokog stepena ; na kome su narodi koji nas opkoljavaju , kao njemci i italijani ; tada , iako bi nae cijepanje po kulturi bilo čudo u dananje doba , opet nas to ne bi barem izlagalo opasnosti , da propanemo kao narod . ali nas je malo , u nas je narodna kultura tek u zametku . treba dakle otro braniti tu klicu . naravno , mi se nećemo osamiti od izobraenog svijeta . i srbi primaju plodove zapadne kulture , kao i hrvati ; u tome razlike nema . ali je pitanje , hoćemo li dopustiti da nas ive zakopaju ispod plodova latinske i njemačke kulture , ili ćemo se postepeno razvijati na svojoj narodnoj slavenskoj osnovi , primajući s dvora samo onoliko duevne hrane , koliko na narodni organizam moe da prisvoji bez povrede svoje narodne samostalnosti . u borbi za ivot , koja jednako vlada u čitavoj prirodi , i u razvitku naroda , velike , jače kulture nameću se manjim narodima , unitavajući njihove osobine . to smo osjetili svi mi slaveni katolici u dalmaciji . ako mali narodi nemaju dobro razvijena oruja da očuvaju svoju osobnost , ako se cijepaju , ako u samom narodu postoje zjala rastvorena neograničenu prodiranju stranih kultura , tad se ne mogu odrati u borbi za opstanak . isticanjem narodnog dualizma , kao to čine hrvati , narodna se obrana slabi ; a isticanjem zapadne kulture , po kojoj  kako tu skoro reče spljetski « narod »  hrvati su blii italijanima , nego li srbima , stvaraju se zjala stranim kulturama , da podave i srbe i hrvate . s toga srbi katolici smatraju da je narodni dualizam poguban opstanku slavenskog naroda u dalmaciji , i da nam se nameće zajednica u radu na narodnom polju , kao nuan uvjet za spasenje svoga bića . ali se ovdje nameće pitanje , koja struja treba da nas ujedini u obrani svoje zajedničke narodnosti : srpska ili hrvatska ? zaista nije bilo , niti danas ima lica , koji je srbin ili hrvat , samo za ljubav tijem slovima sloenim u riječi . ali svako od tijeh imena ima svoj sadraj , svako predstavlja pravac , struju narodnom razvitku .  treba dakle izviditi koji pravac bolje obezbjeđuje narodni opstanak i razvitak srba i hrvata , jer će taj pravac , ili prije ili poslije , pobijediti i u srba i u hrvata ; a na to nam odgovara nauka , i čitava priroda . najstalnija pojava u prirodi jeste borba za ivot : « u nj ratuje ivina s ivinom , u nj ratuje narod sa narodom , u nj ratuje čovjek sa čovjekom. » u toj borbi za ivot moe da odri svoj opstanak samo onaj organizam , koji najbolje osjeća nudu obrane i koji je najbolje snabdjeven zgodnim orujem da očuva svoju osobnost . taj zakon vlada u čitavoj prirodi . jo prije darvina to nam je javio srpski pjesnik petar petrović njegu : « ite svijet neko djeistvije , dunost rađa neko popečenje , obrana je s ivotom skopčana . sve priroda snabdjeva orujem , protiv neke neobuzdne sile , protiv nude , protiv nedovoljstva : otro osje odbranjuje klasje , trnje ruu brani očupati. » u jeziku , u slovima , u običajima , u crkvi , pravoslavni su srbi najbolje obranili i sačuvali nepomućenu narodnu osobnost . nauka danas i ne zna za drugi naziv naeg jezika , osim srpskog naziva . u mikloićevu « slovaru esti slavjanskih jazikov » , koji je kao kruna njegovomu radu , nije ni spomenut hrvatski , ili slovenski jezik , već samo srpski. » 4 . zastava srpske boje mirko komnenović u dobroti se je od prije dralo , da su srbi i hrvati jedan te isti slavjanski narod , pa pod ovim posljednjim imenom zagovarala se je narodna sloga , u ime koje vijale su se slobodno i bez ičijeg prigovora pred crkvom sv . ivana , zajedno srpska i hrvatska zastava , dokle su se i razdrle , a od kad je postanulo pitanje , da li su bokelji srbi , da li hrvati , od tada se je i porodio runi razdor među braćom zadarski « srpski glas » br . 6/1893 . u rubrici « pabirci » izvjetava o posjeti boki kotorskoj c. k. poglavara marojčića te , između ostalog , navodi : « ... pavo kamenarović , koji , po ovom priznanju , ima zasluga u borbi za narodna prava . sad je dunost hrvatske tampe , da taj događaj bistri i da se brani , dunost « n . lista » , « naroda » i t. d. , a ne jednoga dopisnika , koji se krije . ako ne odgovori , i ako se ne obrani , ostaje dokazano , da je na zastupnik istinu govorio , da smo mi istinu pisali i da se ig ne moe zbrisati , koji smo ovoj tampi udarili na čelo , pozivljući se na jednoga svjedoka , do danas nepobijenoga . poto se pak dopisnik « n . lista » pozivlje na pučko učiteljstvo , mi se nadamo , da će mu kolska vlast učiniti po volji , te da će kolska vlast ovaj događaj ispitati , i da će , radi ugleda naeg zaista rodoljubnog pučkog učiteljstva i radi zadaće pučkijeh kola , istrijebiti iz njih one nesretne učitelje , koji se bave političkijem petljanijama i kuju lane denuncije . * * * primili smo dopis iz herceg novoga o poznatom prolasku barona marojčića . iz istoga vadimo nekoliko momenata , poto smo već dovoljno pisali o stvari . parobrod , koji je vozio barona marojčića , vijugao je po zalijevu bokekom i oblazio sve male općine srba katoličke vjere , pa je čak iao pod selo kraiće , općine lutičke , u kome ima neto 14 kuća katoličkijeh . u herceg-novome izali su pred slavljenika i njegove pratioce apotekar đonović i testar palatin . poslije , pristao je u drutvo potar baldani . od općine i od naroda nije niko goste dočekao , ili s njima pristao . i ako je iz kotora općini javljen dolazak barona marojčića , načelnik gojković , koji zna dočekivati goste kao i sav narod one dične općine , nije im izaao na susret , jer je vidio , da je ta pratnja i slava samo jedna politička demonstracija protiv srba i protiv jezgrovitog i istinskog govora dra kvekvića . to se tiče hvale « velikoga hrvata » đunija , da je marojčić dijelio pomoć pravoslavnijem siromasima , dopisnik opaa , da je c. k. poglavarstvo kotorsko , za marojčića , dalo općini lutičkoj neku pomoć od f. 250 , i ako je u njoj najveća nevolja bila . po tome je u juniju 1892 grad obio vinograde i masline u lutici i odnio polovicu ploda . lutica nema druge ljetine do masline i vinograda , pa kad se općina obratila na vladu za pomoć , preko zemaljskoga odbora , vlada je odgovorila , poto je primila izvjetaj c. k. poglavara marojčića , da stanje u lutici nije najgore . svakako po ovom dopisu ispada , da baron marojčić nije siromanom narodu nita dijelio iz svoje kese  dok « nar . list » to ne dokae ! » iz dobrote alje polemične tekstove hrvatskom « narodnom listu » , te u « srpskom glasu » br . 10 iz 1893. god . ističe : « dopis iz boke kotorske dne 13 tekućega , uvrten u broju 14 cijenjenog « narodnog lista » , nije me , ne , ni malo iznenadio , zato već poznajem « la mia gente » , te moram ba da alim na to smo spali . i doista ne zasluuje , da se na nj osvrnem , a jo manje to moji mjetani o samoj stvari već su danas istinito obavijeteni , a moji ostali poznanici , pa i da nijesu čitali moj ispravak u broju 11 « n . l. » , ne bi mogli vjerovati da moj napadnik istinu govori . nego bi mu moda vjerovali i krivo o meni pomislili , časni čitatelji « narodnoga lista » , koji skromnu moju osobu ne poznaju , pak ću mu se zato , za ovaj put odazvati . ja bih se bio iznevjerio načelima građanske slobode , počitanju osobnih uvjerenja i ljubavi prema bratskoj slozi , ovim lijepim svojstvima starih naih dobroćana , kad bih se bio protivio bou kamenaroviću da , izvjeenjem jedne proste trobojnice srpske boje , javno istakne svoja osobita osvjedočenja o svojoj narodnosti . i tim manje mogah to učiniti , kad takva trobojnica nipoto nije znamen političke stranke , već samo jest obiljeje srpske narodnosti , koju u dobroti pripoznaje dobar dio mojih zemljaka , koji nijesu voljni da se kunu « in verba magistri » . u dobroti se je od prije dralo , da su srbi i hrvati jedan te isti slavjanski narod , pa pod ovim posljednjim imenom zagovarala se je narodna sloga , u ime koje vijale su se slobodno i bez ičijeg prigovora pred crkvom sv . ivana , zajedno srpska i hrvatska zastava , dokle su se i razdrle , a od kad je postanulo pitanje , da li su bokelji srbi , da li hrvati , od tada se je i porodio runi razdor među braćom . ja sam se evo već preko trideset godina vazda borio protiv autonomaima i protiv svakome , koji nije zagovarao sjedinjenje sa hrvatskom i to pod barjakom narodne stranke , te i danas , i ako bogme već vojnik u pričuvi , ne ustručavam se od boja , ali nijesam nigda čuo od najstarijih dobroćana , to sam ih od moga djetinjstva poznavao , da su nai stari iz hrvatske , a naprotiv čuo sam vie * * * * da su doli iz srbije , iz bosne , iz crne gore itd. , pak u smislu nae narodnosti , da pravo rečem , ni ja se ne mogu rijeiti za hrvatstvo . eto zato sam bio suglasan , da se u dobroti slobodno izvjesi zastava srpske boje . a ma to bezimeni dopisnik pie , da sam tobo bio suglasan « napadaju fakina itd. » , to je samo prosta la i gadno opadanje , koje on ne bi imao obraza da meni reče oči u oči , kao to podlo pod krinkom bezimenika misli da smije činiti . o takvim fakinima niti je dr kvekvić to govorio , niti je slova o tome bilo u dopisu uvrtenom u prvom broju « n . l. » , niti dosljedno , ja sam imao ta u toj raboti da ispravim , već je to novi jedan dar bezočnog klevetnika , bačen na mene i na boa kamenarovića , dočim svak u dobroti i u kotoru danas već čisto znade , da izgred kotorskih fakina preko dobrote jest izazvalo urlikanje , zvidanje i bukanje , koje se zbilo nekoliko * * * * pred ivanjdan od strane zlo napućene male i velje , na alost dobrotske dječurlije prama osobam , koje vozeći se lađom preko čarobnoga kotorskog zaliva , pjevale su , između ostaloga , neke srpske pjesme . to pak moj dopisnik kae , da sam ja jednu lanu denunciju potvrdio , ni to istina nije . ja sam samo u mome ispravku rekao istinsku istinu , to jest potvrdio sam , da je onu lanu denunciju protiv meni jedan učitelj u pero kazivao perovođi , pak je najprvi potpisao , a o naem « rodoljubnom pučkom učiteljstvu kao takovom » govora bilo nije . koliko je pak istinita ova tvrdnja , da sam ja iskrivio « obavjest bratstva političkoj vlasti » , dosta je da se zna da sve to sam ja u mom ispravku kazao o toj obavijesti , sve sam od slova do slova prepisao iz zapisnika , koji se nalazi u općini pod brojem 419 godine 1892. o čem se moe lasno osvjedočiti kogod hoće . a sada neka razboriti , nepristrani tioc prosudi , ko lae , ko iskrivljuje ; ja koji moja pisma potpisujem ili onaj bezimeni dopisnik , koji onako na mene iz busije napada . nego je uprav smijean ovaj čovo , kad se ističe velikodunim te veli da « potonje ne odgovara obzirom na proaste zasluge starine pava » i to poto je na toga starinu sve one podle klevete svalio . oh , da je on iole obzira imao , ne velim « na starina pava » , nego na svoj obraz , na svoje rođeno mjesto , na svoju narodnost i na svoju političku stranku , ako ju ima , te koju misli da se takim orujem braniti smije , ne bi bio svoje pismo gadnim potvoram nakitio niti bi se sramio svoje pismo potpisati. » 5 . srpska krv boke pravoslavna crkva sv . luke , kotor na cetinju povodom obodske svečanosti u ime srba iz dalmacije , dubrovnika i boke , kamenarović dri poznatu zdravicu , objavljenu u « srpskom glasu » br . 32. iz 1893. g. « ne pita se ko se kako krsti , no čija mu krvca grije prsi , čije l ' ga je

i tako biva te se u bokeljskog srbina , pored svih plemenitih osobina koje su naem narodu već u krvi , obrazuje i neka druga narav , neko naročito fizičko i psihičko obličje , kojim se on od ostale svoje braće potpuno odvaja i koje mora da u toj braći izaziva čuđenje ... mnogi posumnjaju u srpsku krv boke . ali to ičuđavanje ne traje dugo , jer se uskoro iz svakog od njih ičauri kičeljivi starosjedilac koji svoje porijeklo dovodi od kosova i u svoje pređe ubraja strahinj-bana i marka kraljevića ... i dalje , kao stari novljanin , ne bez ponosa ističe : « glavno mesto u boki kotorskoj po starinskom opredelenju i po zvaničnoj dezignaciji je grad kotor . ali je moralna prestonica , bez pogovora herceg-novi . ovim ne obaram vrednosti kotoru i ostaloj boki , ali , badava . novi je mesto gde se najbolje srbuje i gde je tuđinska dosad najmanje mogla da pusti korena. » ( navodi iz knjige « boka i bokelji » krtoljanina laza kostića ) . i , nisu samo srpski nacionalni prvaci u boki , dubrovniku i dalmaciji , na razmeđu vjekova , isticali svoj rod i rodoslov , već se javljaju i iri slojevi naroda , publicisti , istorici , knjievnici i crkva . svi oni su na fonu srpskog bića i porijekla , polemiući uspjeno sa protivslovljima vremena , kratkog pamćenja i nametnutog zaborava , čiji je osnovni cilj unitenje srpskog etnosa . tako list « dubrovnik » polemiući sa anonimnim autorom knjiice « dubrovčani jesu li hrvati ? » koja se pojavila 1892 , navodi kako se pomenuti anonimac bavi čakavtinom kao domicilnim govorom dubrovčana starijih generacija . « dubrovnik » osporava te navode i sve ostale koji su pretendovali da budu njihova istina , pa kae da je čakavtina presađena , a da je izvorni govor dubrovnika uvijek bio tokavski . « jagićev arhiv »  navodi se dalje  « je sasvim obalio taj hrvatski na staru dubrovačku knjievnost , pak sami primjer pučkog govora , za čakavskog knjievnog vremena , i ostali izvori potvrđuju nas u toj misli . prvi dubrovački umjetnici pisci , nai dioskuri , čakavski pjesnici bjehu divo drić i iko menčetić ... » a ko je njih uputio u taj strani način pisanja , kad je u dubrovniku bio od vajkada pučki govor tokavsko-ijekavski . « ovo kolence iz dubrovačkog arhiva »  navodi dalje list  « čakavtina nije nigde do dubrovnika doprla i ovaj grad od početka bio je tokavski ... poto su srbi , ma gdje bili tokavci , eto prave karakteristike srpstva u dubrovniku , i dubrovčani su srbi . a ima li hrvata tokavaca ? mikloić kae da nema . koliko je hrvatima bio potreban tokavski izgovor vidjeće se po tome to su ikavski , kajkavski i čakavski izbacili iz svog knjievnog jezika . srpski jezik u bosni je jedini jezik , a fratar jukić  banjalučanin u svom « kolu » veli da bonjaci ne znadu za ime hrvatsko. » i « dubrovnik » , kao i kamenarović , polemie o srbima-katolicima pa veli : « ko to kae da nema srba izvan pravoslavlja . niko pametan , ostale vjere iz srpstva neće istisnuti . u spomen srpstvu , pominju se starovjerci , te imena brda , dolina , mjesta , porodica . zatijem običaji i nonja srpska . istina ovu nonju mnogi su mukarci pometli , jer su mahom svi pomorci , ali enskadija je sačuvala prilično narodnu srpsku nonju . povelje , testamenti su ćirilicom napisani . osim toga jo se spominje svijeća , biva novac , to su srpski kaluđeri s brda atosa primali za naknadu od dubrovačke republike . a da je rat ( ston ) u zamaaju istočne crkve potvrđuje stonska eparhija , utemeljena od sv . save. » i dalje  « da jedan kraj hrićanski , postane krćanskijem i obratno za srednji vijek , to je bilo lake nego bi bilo sad ( ! sic m. v.  p. ) jer te dvije ispovijedi onda nije dijelilo drugo , nego obred , a to je dubrovnik na ovoj obali bio straa katoličanstva , a svi krajevi dubrovački , malo po malo , se polatinie ( ali ne uticajem kaptola i hrvata , već rima i venecije  prim . m. v.  p. )  zato konavljani zovu hrićane da su « stare ruke » ( starog obreda ) , a sebe cijene da su « nove ruke » . za taj isti razlog zovu nae vodokrće ( bogojavljenje ) stari boić . pa i tada mnogi konavljani nalau badnjake , kao i na latinski badnji dan . konavljani naučeni u staro doba imaju oenjene popove , kao eno ti po istočnom obredu i enu nazivaju popadijom. » 6 . teina srpske sudbine valtazar bogiić zaputene srpske zemlje od cetine nanie , te bosna i hercegovina , nakon propasti srpskog carstva , napadaju i odnarođuju jezuiti , franjevci , benjamin kalaj , kardinal bauer , izdano pomagani papinskom dravom « u međuvremenu izbrisani su stari srpski natpisi na grobovima u popovićima , vignjima , lovornu , brotnicama i drugdje . ali ono to je pravo , ivo srpsko obiljeje , to je krsna slava  krsno ime : nikoljdan , miholjdan , lučindan , mitrovdan , đurđevdan ( ne dan sv . jurja  prim . m. v.  p. ) , srđevdan , bijela neđelja , lazarica ( lazareva subota ) , sv . trojica , premovdan , ćepandan . pa ipak i u konavlima je ičezlo srpsko ime i u narodu se elje spominje . evo i tomu razloga . republika , kad bi stekla koji kraj , odma bi nastojala da puk obrati na latinstvo , no kako su srbi ne samo narodnost , nego i vjeru zvali srpskom , trebalo je to prekinuti , jer je nastupilo drugo vjerovanje koje nije srpsko. » « dubrovnik » polemiući dalje sa bezimenim skribomanom veli  « poto je bjelodano dokazano da plemensko i političko hrvatstvo u srpskijem zemljama od cetine ili neretve put juga nije nego sanjarija i izmiljotina i poto po tome nema imenu hrvatskomu u rečenijem zemljama vidnoga traga ni u puku , ni u knjizi , a poto narodni naziv srpski isčezao je iz dubrovačke oblasti isčezom srpske vjere , kako se nazvao jezik i koje mu je sad ime ? sad puk svoj jezik zove naki ( u boki se i danas odnarođeni podrepai slue tim eufemizmom  prim . m. v.  p. ) . pomenuti skriboman , ipak je kao to se vidi osjetio da nije sve isto , ali je ipak onom knjiicom pregao osvojit dubrovnik i njegovu okolinu za hrvatstvo . nije čudo da iza njega o gundulićevoj slavi u dubrovniku je stiglo političara iz zagreba koji su kazali da su doli osvojit i otet dubrovnik . otimlje se i osvaja samo ono to se nema , i to je tuđe »  zaključuje list . konačno , valtazar bogiić , ocjenjujući knjiicu anonimca , kae : « valja mu priznati da je vrlo vjet u izvrtanju istine ; ta je knjiga jako pogibeljna u rukama jednog neznalice , jer u njoj neće naći nego istinu umjetnički izvrnutu. » zaputene srpske zemlje od cetine nanie , te bosna i hercegovina , nakon propasti srpskog carstva , napadaju i odnarođuju jezuiti , franjevci , benjamin kalaj , kardinal bauer , izdano pomagani papinskom dravom . marko car no , pored opasnog jezuitizma , srpski episkop stefan ljubibratić , vrlo obrazovani i uporni zatitnik pravovjernih hrićana kroz dalmaciju , uspijeva ičupati srpsku pravoslavnu crkvu ispod biskupskog iga i torture . u tome je imao priličnu prećutnu podrku alvizija moćeniga , generalnog providura dalmacije , čije je sjedite bilo u zadru . no , njegovu aktivnost prati budno oko nadbiskupa zmajevića , čiji su preci porijeklom iz katunske nahije . taj uporni srpski mrzitelj nosao je svoju biskupsku , te zatim nadbiskupsku katedru od kotora , bara do zadra . uplivie kod pape i mletačkog duda da se opasni izmatik skloni iz dalmacije . i napokon u tome uspijeva . stefan ljubibratić , nećak vladike savatija , biva protjeran iz svoje episkopije . srpski ivalj kroz dalmaciju i dubrovačku republiku se postepeno tanji bez zatite svoje drave , ali u boki , taj proces ni izdaleka nije bio tako izraen , jer je boka po broju pravoslavnih bogomolja , uvijek bila u ogromnoj prednosti . a i srpski ivalj bio je u ozbiljnoj prevagi , čak i onda kada su se strane vojske pripremale za ratne operacije na hercegovinu i crnu goru . pa i tada , a prema austro-ugarskim redovnim popisima , srbi čine 2/3 do 3/5 ukupnog stanovnitva boke . s druge strane , znatan broj srba katolika , ustajao je kad im se god pruila prilika , da pomene svoju slavnu istoriju , ako nita drugo , a ono da « puk » ne pogubi svoje korijene . narodna zastava ujedinjenih hrvata i srba na tom pravcu je i drutvo « hrvatski i srpski narodni dom » , osnovano 1904. godine u cavtatu , koje je nalo da drutvena zastava treba da bude srpska pa hrvatska na jednom koplju . « svrha drutva je prosvjeta narodna , a sastoji se u buđenju narodne svijesti plemena hrvatskoga i srpskoga. » drutvena gesla su : « 1 ) jedini neprijatelj  neznanje ; jedino sredstvo  ljubav ; jedina svrha  sloboda . 2 ) brat je mio , bio hrvat , srbin bio . 3 ) balkan balkancima. » srbi katolici , ma gdje se nalazili , rano su osjetili svu teinu srpske sudbine uzrokovane razurom helenizma , a zatim podjelom velikog carstva , gdje je papinska drava rastakala pravoslavlje , jer je bila i jeste drava u dravi . preko te moćne ovozemaljske tvorevine , rimska drava je i dalje nastavila da postoji . no , gle apsurda . dok smo bili pod tuđinskom zastavom , katolici su vie njegovali svoja stara , srpska ishodita , ali kad dopadoe kaptolskog filioque-a bivaju pritjerivani na izjanjavanje kao hrvati . dakle , katolik  hrvat , bio on srbin , roman , italijan ili grk . ti ljudi bivaju silom odvajani od apostolskih vremena potovanja duha svetoga . a za njegovo zadobijanje , kae sv . serafim sarovski nisu dovoljne samo posti , molitve i darovi siromasima , jer ni jedno dobro djelo ne donosi plodove duha svetoga , ako nije učinjeno iz ljubavi prema hristu . gospod kae : « ko sa mnom ne sabira  rasipa » . ti nai srbi katolici postepeno podlijeu papinskoj zemaljskoj dravi , koja predvodi zapadnu hedonističku civilizaciju , to ubrzano zida « vavilonsku građevinu » i jedan milenijski jezik  engleski , smjeten u titrave ekrane opteg sljepila . sila ih i strah za budućnost goni da se sve vie odriču svojih predaka .\n",

      "kotromanic was been serbian kingdom dinasty : bosna do pojave prvih kotromanića srpska bosna i srpska dinastija kotromanic ! smatra se da se ime bosna po prvi put javilo u jednom spisu konstantina porfirogenita ( sredina x veka ) i to na onom mestu gde o u opisu srbije navodi : `` u krtenoj srbiji jesu ovi naseljeni gradovi : destinikom , cernauvski , megiretus , dresnik , salines , a u kraju bosni katera i desnik '' . u to doba bosna se nije smatrala dravom već samo delom rake kojom je tada vladao knez časlav . o bosni su i inače veoma siromani podaci i do sredine x veka o njoj se ne zna bilo ta pouzdanije . nazire se tek da je njome upravljao ban , a ova titula ima verovatno avarsko poreklo . `` ponekad je vladao celom bosnom samo jedan vladar , a ponekad je vlast bila podeljena na mnogo vladara od kojih je svako vladao za sebe '' ( mavro orbin ) . nakon časlavljeve smrti , počele su smutnje u rakoj , to je bosna iskoristila i osamostalila se . no , to nije dugo trajalo , tek do 968. godine kada hrvatski kralj mihailo kreimir i udari na bosnu i zauzme celu zemlju . bosanski ban je pobegao u ugarsku , a bosna je postala sastavni deo hrvatske drave . ni hrvatska vlast nije dugo trajala , već je uskoro smenjuje vizantija . nakon smrti vizantijskog cara vasilija ( 1025 . ) naglo opada moć carstva to koriste bosna , duklja i raka i osamostaljuju se . u vremenu između 1082-1085. godine dukljanski kralj bodin uspeva da sve te tri drave stavi pod svoju kontrolu . u bosni je postavio za bana nekog stefana , dok je u raku postavio vukana . ni ovo jedinstvo nije dugo trajalo , tek do bodinove smrti ( 1102. godine ) . to je bilo poslednji put da je bosna bila u sastavu rake drave i od tada ona vodi svoj samostalni ivot koji će biti često u sukobu sa onim koji se vodio u rakoj . iste te godine kada je umro bodin ( 1102 . ) , pala je i hrvatska pod ugarsku vlast . nedugo potom uzeli su ugari i bosnu , a kralj bela ii je na saboru u ostrogonu ( 1139 . ) svome mlađem sinu ladislavu ( tada maloletnom ) dodelio bosnu . iz nekog teko objanjivog razloga ugari bosnu tada nazivaju ramom , a ugarski kralj nosi naziv `` kralj ugarske , dalmacije , hrvatske i rame '' . nejasan je razlog tome , budući da je rama bila tek deo bosne , a sasvim je izvesno da su ugari drali celu bosnu pod svojom vlaću . bosnom su i do tada upravljali banovi , a tako je bilo i za vreme ugarske vladavine . ko su oni bili ostaje tajna , a prvi o kojem se neto vie zna jeste ban borić . za celo vreme svoje vladavine bio je verni ugarski vazal i u okviru ugarske vojske ratovao je protiv vizantije pod braničevom . neku istaknutu ulogu u ovom ratu nije odigrao pa ni po tome nije ostao upamćen . nakon te kratkotrajne ratne avanture ban borić se umeao u dinastičke borbe u ugarskoj , ali na slabijoj strani to ga je dovelo u sukob sa ugarskim kraljem . rezultat te nesmotrenosti bilo je njegovo smenjivanje . odmah potom bosna je pala opet pod vizantiju ( 1166 . ) i pod njenom vlaću bila sve do smrti cara manojla i komnena ( 1180. ) . ostaje otvoreno pitanje da li je odmah nakon pada bosne pod vizantiju ( 1166 . ) bansku čast zauzeo kulin ban . ako je tako , odnosno ako je vizantija bila ta koja ga je postavila na bansku čast , on je bio bez sumnje njen tićenik . ovo je samo mogućnost poto nije sigurno u koje je vreme kulin stvarno doao na vlast , tako da nije bez osnove misliti da je na vlast doao kasnije budući da se po prvi put spominje tek od 1180. godine . u to vreme u rakoj već due vreme vlada veliki upan stefan nemanja koji je bio pokoran vizantiji ne iz ubeđenja , već iz nude . međutim , odmah nakon smrti vizantijskog cara manojla i , udrueni raani , ugari i bosanci odluče da iskoriste trenutne smutnje oko novoga cara i provaljuju na vizantijsku teritoriju . to je inače bilo jedino ratno dejstvo kulin bana jer je on izbegavao vojne sukobe , oslanjajući se uglavnom na ono to moe da se postigne politikom . smrt cara manojla donela je bosni oslobođenje od vizantije , međutim ne za dugo jer odmah potom ponovo dolazi pod ugarsku vlast . sada je kulin ban vazal ugarskog kralja bele iii . kulin ban je ostao u dobroj uspomeni kod naroda , a to nije čudno budući da se radilo o veoma spretnom političaru koji je umeo da bude sa svima u dobrim odnosima . `` u njegovo vreme bilo je ( kau ) u izobilju svega blaga bojega , tako da i danas običan puk , kad ima velikog obilja , obično kae : vratila su se vremena kulina bana '' ( mavro orbin ) . sa porodicom velikog upana stefana nemanje se čak i orodio budući da se kulinova sestra udala za nemanjinog brata miroslava . dok je u bosni , zahvaljujući kulinu , vladao mir u rakoj se počinjale smutnje . tokom 1196. godine sa prestola u rakoj se povukao stefan nemanja , a tokom 1200. godine je i umro . stefan nemanja je ostavio raku na vladanje mlađem sinu stefanu , ali to stariji sin vukan nije nikako mogao da pretrpi budući da je on bio stariji i da je po dotadanjim pravilima raka trebala pripasti njemu . potajna netrpeljivost je uskoro prerasla u krvavi građanski rat , a vukan je krenuo na brata stefana . `` posle prestavljenja svetoga starca , dizae se na sve načine nanoseći neprijateljstvo i zlo bratu svojemu stefanu samodrcu , i uzimajući u pomoć mnoge inoplemene narode , .. '' ( teodosije ) . dok se sve to deavalo u rakoj , kulin ban je imao problema sa bogumilskom jeresi . ta je verska sekta uzela tolikog maha u bosni da se papa jedno vreme razmiljao da pokrene krstaki rat i da bogumile istrebi . moguće da ta jeres ne bi imala toliku snagu da joj vladari bosne nisu pruali sasvim otvorenu podrku , a to nikako nije moglo ostati papi nepoznato . `` doznali smo da je nedavno splitski nadbiskup proterao iz splita i trogira veći broj patarena , a da je plemeniti mu kulin ban bosanski dao onim grenicima ne samo sigurno sklonite , nego i javnu pomoć i izloio njihovoj zloći svoju zemlju i sebe samoga , pa ih je častio kao katolike , čak i vie nego katolike , nazivajući ih hrićanima '' , pie papa ugarskom kralju emeriku . uz to mu naređuje da se obrati kulinu i da ovaj iz bosne protera bogumile , a u suprotnom , ako kulin ne poslua , da pokrene vojsku na bosnu . kulin je do kraja uspeo da ovaj problem rei na sebi svojstven način . tokom 1203. godine papska komisija je izvrila uvid u situaciju i na neki način kulin je uspeo da se opravda , to je za trenutak skinulo opasnost od bosne . nedugo potom kulin je i umro . kulina je nasledio neki stefan za koga postoje samo maglovite pretpostavke da je kulinov sin . od samoga početka stefan je imao dobre odnose sa ugarskim dvorom i tamo je često boravio . u bosni nije bio mnogo omiljen budući da je progonio bogumile , to govori da se na vlasti odravao isključivo zahvaljujući ugarskoj pomoći . u vreme njegovo banovanja u rakoj se mnogo toga desilo . najpre je vukan uspeo da svrgne sa upanskog prestola svoga brata stefana , ali samo za kratko . veoma brzo , uspeo je stefan ( prvovenčani ) da se povrati na presto i da se 1217. godine okruni kraljevskom krunom . dok se sve to deavalo , u bosni su bogumili toliko ojačali da je papa odlučio da ovaj put stvarno pokrene krstaki rat i da tu jeres konačno iskoreni . u tom okviru pokrenuo je veoma ivu diplomatsku aktivnost . za sve to vreme o banu stefanu nema nigde nikakvih pomena , a papa ga nigde niti hvali niti kudi . po svemu sudeći bio je gorljivi katolik , ali u bosni se njegova reč nije mnogo sluala . to je dovelo do toga da bude u bosni omrznut i da negde oko 1332. godine ( ili dve do tri godine kasnije ) bude svrgnut sa vlasti . povukao se u usoru kod svoga sina , kneza sibislava , gde je , najkasnije do 1336. godine , umro . bana stefana nasledio je ( po svemu sudeći nasilno ) ban matej ninoslav . njega su na bansku čast uzdigli bogumili , to je pomalo čudno budući da je u prvo vreme ban ninoslav ( dok jo nije postao ban ) bio protivnik bogumila , verni ugarski vazal i gorljivi katolik . papa mu pie ljubazna pisma i obraća mu se sa `` grleći te iskrenom ljubavi , tvoju osobu i tvoju zemlju bosnu primamo pod zatitu sv . petra i nau sa svim imanjima , koje sada pravedno dri , i utvrđujemo te zatitom ovoga pisma te strogo zabranjujemo , da se bilo ko usudi da te uznemirava , dok ostane u katoličkoj veri ... itd . '' tada počinje da se spominje i ninoslavov rođak prijezda koji se navodno ponovo iz jeresi vratio u katoličku veru . kako se prijezdi nije mnogo verovalo to je morao da dominikancima ostavi svoga sina kao zalogu svoje iskrene namere da ostane u katoličkoj veri . budući da se prijezda isticao progonima bogumila to je izgledalo da je postao iskreni katolik , pa je papa naredio dominikancima da mu vrate sina . u tom momentu on jo uvek nije ličnost većeg formata , ali će kasnija istorija da ga upozna kao verovatnog rodonačelnika porodice kotromanić . ban ninoslav je bio jedno vreme verni ugarski vazal , ali na ugarskom dvoru ga nisu ozbiljno shvatali smatrajući ga tek nekim od ugarskih dravnih slubenika . takva poniavajuća uloga je doivela svoj vrhunac kada je ugarski kralj andrija , kao da ne postoji ban ninoslav , poklonio bosnu hercegu kolomanu ( 1234. ) . time je dovedena samostalnost bosne u pitanje , ali i vlast bana ninoslava . istovremeno , to je ohrabrilo i kneza sibislava ( sina umrlog bana stefana ) da počne da navaljuje na one delove bosne kojima je vladao ninoslav , pokuavajući time da uzme za sebe bansku čast . da se stvar jo vie zaplete pobrinula se crkva koja se neprestano nosila sa bogumilima , ali uz veoma slabe rezultate . eleći da nekako slomi tu jeres papa je svrgnuo dotadanjeg bosanskog biskupa ( bogumila po svemu sudeći ) , a na njegovo mesto je imenovao pripadnika dominikanskog reda , nemca johana . u bosni je buknulo otvoreno nezadovoljstvo jer niko nije hteo nemca za biskupa . to je bilo sasvim dovoljno da i papa grgur ix izgubi strpljenje i da naredi da 1234. godine započne krstaki rat . kako je papa smatrao bana ninoslava za glavnog krivca svih ovih događaja , jer se ban nije dovoljno trudio da iskoreni jeres , a da bi mu jo vie napakostio , potvrdi darovnicu ugarskog kralja andrije po kojoj bosna pripada hercegu kolomanu ( 1235. ) . rat je trajao skoro pet godina i krstai su uskoro preplavili bosnu . u samome početku bosanci su se uspeno branili , a da je rat bio iscrpljujući vidi se iz toga to je novom biskupu johanu bilo svega dosta u tolikoj meri da je traio od pape da ga razrei nove dunosti . papa ga je pokuao ubediti piući mu : `` ako te tekoće ratne pritiću , ljubav prema bogu , prema tvojoj dui i poverenoj ti crkvi trae od tebe , da do smrti ne bei od tvoje teke slube . stoga te savetujemo , da odustane od molbe za ostavku i ne ostavi upravu tvoje crkve , nego da na jeretike i ostale protivnike katoličke vere muki i jakom rukom udari '' . izgledalo je kao da je cela bosna protiv pape . od bosanskih velikaa jedino je usorski knez sibislav bio uz krstae i zbog toga ga papa naziva ljiljanom među trnjem . u svakom slučaju knez sibislav nije protiv bana ninoslava ratovao zbog verskog uverenja ( poto je i tada , a i kasnije ninoslav bio katolik , a nikada bogumil ) već isključivo zbog toga to je eleo za sebe bansku čast . ban ninoslav je pruao od samoga početka otpor , ali pred brojnijim krstaima nije se mogao odrati pa se sklonio negde u blizini dubrovnika gde se sa jednog dela teritorije i dalje branio . u to vreme ( 1240 . ) imao je kontakata sa dubrovnikom i sa njima je sklapao ugovore , to moe da znači da je jo uvek bio dovoljno moćan da bi ga dubrovnik uvaavao . uporan otpor mu se isplatio kada da su tokom 1241. godine tatari provalili u ugarsku i na reci aj strano potukli ugarsku vojsku . između ostalih tu je poginuo i bosanski duman , herceg koloman . kako je ugarski kralj bela iv beao ispred tatara , koloman je bio mrtav , to je ban ninoslav iskoristio povoljnu priliku i povratio celokupnu bosnu . to mu nije bilo dovoljno pa se počeo strano svetiti svima onima koji su u proteklom ratu pruali ugarima pomoć . misleći da ni to nije dovoljno pakosti prema ugarskom kralju beli iv , ban ninoslav se umeao i u sukob splita i trogira , a na strani splita koji se pobunio protiv kralja bele iv . ovaj rat je , uglavnom zahvaljujući ninoslavljevoj vojsci , zavren uspeno za split , ali ugarski kralj bela iv je sve to smatrao veleizdajom . stoga je 1244. godine pokrenuo dve armije , jednu na split , a drugu na ninoslava . koliko je ratnih dejstava bilo , ne zna se , ali ostaje činjenica da su i split i ban ninoslav odmah klonuli te sklopili mir sa ugarskom . i pored svega bogumilstvo se nikako nije moglo iskoreniti iz bosne , to je navelo ugarskog kralja belu iv i kaločkog nadbiskupa da ponovo zatrae od pape inoćentija iv dozvolu za pokretanje novog krstakog rata . ovaj put situacija je bilo ozbiljna kao nikada do tada . to je osetio i ban ninoslav pa se stoga pismima počeo direktno obraćati papi ubeđujući ga da je i dalje revni katolik i da nikada nije bio bogumil . po svemu sudeći to je bila i istina , a to su papi potvrdile i komisije koje je slao u bosnu . `` kako smo doznali , nije plemeniti gospodin ninoslav , ban bosanski , odstupio od prave vere , nego ivi kao katolik i opsluuje hrićanske propise , iako je nekada u nevolji dobio pomoć i naklonost jeretika protiv svojih neprijatelja . poto smo po nekim verodostojnim pismima , iako starim , dobili pohvalne potvrde o čistoći njegove vere , naređujemo ti , da dobro upamti , da se nadasve mora imati pred očima i postići spas due , da ne ustane protiv spomenutog bana i njegove zemlje , posebno sada ... '' , pie papa kaločkom nadbiskupu ( 1248. ) . time je za bosnu skinuta opasnost od novog ugarskog pohoda . sve to moglo bi se uslovno nazvati pobedom bana ninoslava budući da vie nije uznemiravan . ostatak svoga ivota on je proveo baveći se uglavnom unutranjim stvarima u bosni . sa susednom rakom nikada nije bio u dobrim odnosima , a to se posebno vidi iz ugovora koje je sklapao u dva navrata sa dubrovnikom ( 1240. i 1249. ) . u njima se on obavezuje da će pomoći dubrovnik `` ako se razratite s kraljem rakim , da vas ne dam ni va dobitek , .. '' . u vreme sklapanja ovih ugovora u rakoj je vladao kralj stefan vladislav i ( ugovor iz 1240 . ) i kralj stefan uro i ( ugovor iz 1249. ) . nedugo nakon sklapanja ovoga drugog ugovora ( 1249 . ) umro je i ban ninoslav . 2 . prvi kotromanići nakon smrti bana ninoslava počele su u bosni smutnje oko njegovog nasleđa . sam ninoslav je iza sebe ostavio dovoljno potomaka i rođaka , to daljih to bliih , da bi se između njih mogao izabrati dostojan naslednik . međutim , sada su se tu pojavile različite aspiracije . bogumili su hteli da bosnu preuzme neko ko će njima biti naklonjen , dok su ugari eleli za bana nekoga iz njihove interesne sfere . na kraju je u toj zbrci pobedu odneo ugarski kralj bela iv uspevi da naturi svoga kandidata . bio je to dalji ninoslavov rođak prijezda o kojem je već bilo govora . on je izgleda jedno vreme bio bogumil , ali se kasnije povratio u katoličku veru i bio čak jedan od revnijih progonitelja jeresi u bosni . kako mu je sin bio talac kod dominikanskih fratara , to se moe posredno izvući zaključak da njegovo ponovno pokatoličavanje nije bili toliko dobrovoljno koliko prisilno . jo u vreme krstakih ratova po bosni u vremenu između 1234-1239. godine pojavljuje se prijezda sa titulom bosanskog bana . to postavlja neka pitanja . naime , u vremenu kada je bosna pala pod vlast hercega kolomana , a kako je ban ninoslav izbegao , to se bosna smatrala zemljom bez vladara . moguće da je u to vreme koloman za bana postavio svoga čoveka , a to je bio upravo prijezda . kratko je trajalo njegovo prvo banovanje , jedva dve godine , jer se ninoslav , nakon ugarske katastrofe na reci aj , vratio u bosnu . kako se on tada strano svetio ugarskim pristalicama to je sigurno i sam prijezda bio u smrtnoj opasnosti , pa je verovatno izbegao u ugarsku . ovo drugo ustoličenje prijezde za bana bosne nije prolo bez trzavica . ninoslavovi sinovi , smatrajući da banska čast pripada njima , pruili su otpor koji je bio toliko jak da je kralj bela iv morao slati vojsku koja bi pomogla prijezdi da uzme vlast . da je bilo jakog otpora vidljivo je iz pisama koje je kralj bela iv slao papi i u kojima se naveliko ali da ga neprijatelji pritiskaju sa svih strana . no , na kraju je pobuna savladana , a prijezda je preuzeo vlast . osim bosne , tada je savladan i hum ( 1254. ) . nakon svega ugarski kralj odluči da bosnu podeli na dva dela . od porečja gornjega vrbasa i bosne formirao je banovinu bosnu gde su vladali banovi iz roda biveg bana ninoslava . drugi deo bosne je sačinjen od usore i soli gde je ugarski kralj direktno imenovao banove . to je bilo vreme formiranja banovina koje su trebale da tite granice ugarske . kralj bela iv je tada pokuao i da već postojeću mačvansku banovinu ojača time to ju je nakon smrti svoga zeta rostislava , koji je njome do tada upravljao , uzdigao na rang hercegovine ( vojvodine ) i njenom vladaru omogućio irenje uticaja na usoru i soli , a moguće čak i na bosnu . mačvanska banovina je time postala veoma jaka i njenim gospodarima je omogućavala da u narednim periodima gospodare bosnom , a ponekad sremom i braničevom . da je bila jaka vidi se iz toga to je herceg bela ( unuk kralja bele iv ) , kao gospodar mačvanske banovine , uspeo da 1268. godine slomi napad rakog kralja stefana uroa i i da ga čak u tim sukobima i zarobi . tokom 1270. godine umro je ugarski kralj bela iv , a nasledio ga je sin stevan v. u ratovima koje je tada vodio novi ugarski kralj poginuo je i mačvanski vojvoda bela ( 1272 . ) , a nedugo zatim umre i sam kralj stevan v. nasledio ga je desetogodinji sin ladislav iv kumanac ( 1272-1290 . ) , dok je regenstvo vrila kraljica-majka elizabeta . u to vreme kao bosanski ban spominje se neki ugarski velika stefan . to je bila pomalo čudna situacija budući da je i prijezda nosio istu titulu , ali po svemu sudeći tu vlast nije i vrio na teritoriji cele bosne i na neki način ta mu je titula bila samo `` prazna '' počast bez potpune sadrine . titulu bosanskog bana dobijali su kasnije jo neki ugarski velikai , a među njima i severinski ban , inače dvorski rizničar ( ban ugrin ) . ban prijezda se oko 1287. godine povukao sa vlasti i na svom imanju u zemljeniku provodio je svoje poslednje dane . ne zna se ta je moglo biti uzrokom njegovog povlačenja : starost ili je bio prisiljen ? imao je tri sina : prijezdu ii , stjepana i vuka . jedinu ćerku katarinu udao je u hrvatsku kuću babonića . vlast u bosni su podelila njegova dva sina i to tako da je stjepan vladao u istočnom delu bosne dok je prijezda ii vladao u zapadnom delu . po svemu sudeći bansku su čast delili , a to se vidi iz jednog papinog pisma gde se on obraća `` plemenitim muevima stjepanu i prijezdi , banovima bosne '' . u ugarskoj su se tada deavala velika unutranja previranja koja su imala kasnijeg odraza i na bosnu . kralj ladislav iv je odjednom počeo da vri reorganizaciju u dravi pa je tako mačvu , usoru i soli poverio svojoj majci elizabeti ( jelisaveti ) nazivajući je `` vojvotkinjom mačvansko-bosanskom '' ( 1280. ) . u to vreme ponovo se pojavio problem bogumila u bosni , ali kako kralj nije imao mnogo volje da se njima bavi to se sve zavrilo na dopisivanju sa papom . tokom 1284. godine kralj ladislav iv oduzima majci elizabeti upravu nad mačvanskom banovinom i preputa je muu svoje sestre kataline , bivem rakom kralju , stefanu dragutinu . sada je eks raki kralj vladao nad mačvom sa beogradom , usorom i soli , ali i nad nekim srpskim zemljama noseći naziv `` sremski kralj '' : `` i ustavi ode u oblast drave svoje , u zemlju zvanu mačva , koju mu je dao tast njegov kralj ugarski . tamo doavi sa enom svojom blagočastivom kraljicom katelinom i sa jednim delom vlastele svoje , ... '' ( danilo drugi ) . samim tim dobio je odlučujući uticaj nad onim delom bosne kojim su vladali ban prijezde i , a kasnije i njegovi sinovi . za razliku od svojih prethodnika dragutin je bio veoma revnostan u prekrtavanju bogumila . `` mnoge od jeretika bosanske zemlje obrati u hrićansku veru i krsti ih '' ( danilo drugi ) . taj njegov rad na prekrtavanju bogumila nije bio praćen nasiljem , tako da nije poznato da ih je on progonio . `` njegovom blagodaću koja sve daje , dođe u tu zemlju da je prosveti , i da narod , koji je bio u tami i mraku neznanja , po učenju boanskoga pisma privede ka svetlosti spasonosnoga ivota '' ( danilo drugi ) . negde tokom 1291. godine preao je i sam u katoličku veru . kako su dragutin i ban prijezda i bili smotreni političari to su ubrzo uvideli da im je jedini način za opstanak zajednička saradnja . ta se saradnja ubrzo zavrila rodbinskim vezama tako to je prijezdin sin , stjepan i oenio dragutinovu ćerku jelisavetu ( 1284. ) . ova rodbinska veza sigurno da je daleko vie godila stjepanu i negoli dragutinu . zahvaljujući ovoj enidbi doao je stjepan i u najblie rodbinske veze preko tate kataline ( ćerka ugarskog kralja bele iv ) sa ugarskom kraljevskom kućom , ali i sa napuljskom kraljevskom kućom budući da je belina druga ćerka , marija , bila udata za napuljskog kralja karla ii . te su se rodbinske veze jo vie razgranale kada je druga dragutinova ćerka , uroica ( ursa ) udata za moćnog hrvatskog bana pavla i ubića . naravno , tu je bila i rodbinska veza sa kraljevskom kućom nemanjića , preko tasta dragutina . ove rodbinske veze kasnije će da imaju velikog udela u unutranjim previranjima u ugarskoj , ali i mnogo kasnije kada se tvrtko i bude krunisao za kralja . dakle , bila je tu čitava zbrka rodbinskih veza sa arpadovićima , anuvincima , ubićima i nemanjićima . to je svakako razlog za kasnije legende o poreklu porodice kotromanić i o njihovom prezimenu . najpoznatija legenda je ona koju prezentira mavro orbin . po njemu , nakon smrti kulin bana , ugarski kralj je u bosnu poslao jednog svog velikaa , poreklom nemca , koji je imao zadatak da bosnu zauzme . on se zvao kotroman , a kako je bio vet ratnik to je uspeo veoma lako da obavi zadatak . za nagradu , kralj ga je postavio bosanskim banom . `` sada , kad je umro pomenuti kulin ban , kralj koji je u to vreme bio u ugarskoj odluči , iz ranije navedenih razloga , da zauzme bosansko kraljevstvo . zbog toga je poslao s vojskom jednog svog velikaa po imenu kotroman nemac , na glasu ratnika . kad je kotroman doao u bosnu i naao je bez gospodara , lako ju je zauzeo . da bi ga za to nagradio , kralj ga je imenovao banom bosne i hteo da se njegovi potomci večno smenjuju na tom poloaju . poto je porodica kotromana tokom vremena dobila veliko potomstvo , svi su se po kotromanu nazivali kotromanići '' ( mavro orbin ) . da je legenda uhvatila korena vidi se iz nekih dubrovačkih pisama gde se ban naziva `` cotrumano goto '' . danas se misli da kotromanići nisu stranog porekla i da potiču iz neke bosanske plemićke kuće , a da je ban prijezda i tek jedan od njenih pripadnika , nikako utemeljivač ove dinastije . to delimično potvrđuje i mavro orbin kada navodi da je : `` njihova porodica gotovo uvek vladala u bosni . nekad su to bili banovi , a nekad kneevi '' . od enidbe sa dragutinovom ćerkom potpao je ban stjepan i pod njegov uticaj i mnoge stvari koje je činio bile su plod dragutinove volje . da to nije moglo uvek izaći na dobro mogao se uveriti nakon smrti ugarskog kralja ladislava 1290. godine . kako kralj iza sebe nije ostavio dece to se postavilo pitanje naslednika ugarskog prestola . veoma brzo nakon ladislavljeve smrti krunisan je za kralja njegov blizak srodnik andrija iii mlečanin . međutim , kako je imao jaku opoziciju to su odmah počele i smutnje . kao najopasniji protivnik pojavio se napuljski kralj karlo ii ( pripadnik anujske dinastije ) , mu marije , inače sestre kralja ladislava , koji je za svoga sina karla martela zatraio ugarski presto arpadovića . ova je stranka bila veoma jaka pa je na kraju papa nikola iv krunisao karla martela za ugarskog kralja . uz ovu stranu tada su pristupili i najjači hrvatski velikai , bribirski knezovi ubići . u to vreme ovu kuću su sačinjavala tri brata : pavle i , juraj i mladen . kako je dragutinova ćerka ursula ( ursa ) bila udata za pavla ubića to je sasvim razumljivo da su dragutin i zet mu , ban stjepan i kotromanić , pristupili odmah uz ovu stranku . u tim političkim igrama karlo martel im je , ne bi li ih zadrao i dalje kao pristalice , svojim poveljama razdelio dobar deo hrvatske i bosne . da li su ubići dobili uz hrvatsku i bosnu , teko je reći , ali se zna da je dragutinov sin , vladislav , dobio skoro celu slavoniju . izgledalo je da ova stranka ima velike anse , ali tada iznenada umre karlo martel ( 1295. ) . međutim , napuljska kraljica marija dođe na ideju da na ugarski presto zasedne sin karla martela koji se zvao karlo robert ( njen unuk ) . u tom njenom naumu iz sve snage ju je pomagao i papa bonifacije viii koji je čak karla roberta , tada tek dvanaestogodinjeg dečaka , proglasio za ugarskog kralja ( 1297. ) . porodica ubić , imajući pod svojom vlaću hrvatsku proirivala je svoj uticaj eleći da i bosnu podvede pod svoju vlast . početkom 1299. godine pavle ubić se naziva `` gospodarom bosne '' ( dominus bosne ) , a u skladu sa tim , svome bratu mladenu i dodelio je titulu bana bosne . od tada su oni celu bosnu drali pod svojom kontrolom izuzev jednog dela koji se naziva donji krajevi i koje je drao knez hrvatin stjepanić . kako je knez hrvatin bio odan ubićima to su oni izvrili pritisak na napuljskog kralja karla ii roberta da mu izda povelju kojom potvrđuje njegovu vladavinu . `` imajući u vidu na čistoću vernosti , a i na druge korisne i primljene slube to su knez hrvatin i njegovi sinovi i braća , rođaci plemenitih pavla , bana hrvata , a i braće njegove jurja i mladena , knezova dalmatinskih gradova , ljubljeni i verni nai , nama činili i sada jo čine u poslu kraljevstva ugarske , potvrđujemo rečenome hrvatinu , sinovima i braći njegovoj donje krajeve zemlje bosanske koje sada dre i poseduju '' . sredinom 1300. godine uspeo je pavle ubić da karla ii roberta dovede u split , a onda kroz hrvatsku u zagreb . sada se već spremao rat jer andrija iii mlečanin nije imao nameru da tek tako prepusti krunu . međutim , iz nepoznatog razloga u sred priprema za rat umre kralj andrija iii . iako je ostao bez glavnog protivnika karlo robert je imao mnotvo protivnika u ugarskoj pa je sve do 1309. godine morao da vodi borbe sa njima . dok se sve to deavalo mladen ubić je pokuavao da celokupnu bosnu stavi pod svoju kontrolu . naravno da sve ovo ban stjepan i kotromanić nije mirno posmatrao i orujem se suprotstavio ovim aspiracijama ubića . no , bio je beznadeno slabiji i do 1302. godine mladen ubić je postigao dovoljno uspeha da stavi skoro celu bosnu pod svoju kontrolu . stjepan i kotromanić ipak nije bio poraen i odravao se na jednom manjem delu bosne . u to vreme tast dragutin mu nije mogao mnogo pomoći budući da se i sam teko upleo u borbe sa svojim bratom , rakim kraljem milutinom , u borbi oko nasledstva u rakoj . upravo u tim danima zaigrao je dragutin nemanjić veliku igru pokuavajući da svoga sina vladimira progura na ugarski presto . kako je vladislav bio oenjen konstancom morosini , koja je bila u rodu sa pokojnim kraljem andrijom iii , to je i vladislav imao isto onoliko prava na ugarski presto kao i karlo robert . to je bio jo jedan razlog zbog kojeg nije mogao da pomogne svome zetu . ipak i pored toga ban stjepan i kotromanić se drao sasvim dobro , a kada se rat pretvorio u verski jer je mladen ubić nasrnuo na bogumile , ovi svi listom pređu na stranu stjepana i kotromanića . takva mladenova neopreznost kotala ga je i ivota jer ga u jednom sukobu bogumili ubiju ( 1304 ) . nasledio ga je sin mladen ii ubić , ali on nije bio ličnost formata svoga oca . tek uz pomoć vojske koju mu je poslao pavle ubić uspeo je da slomi poslednji otpor . od 1305. godine naziva se pavle ubić `` gospodarem čitave bosne '' . no ni trijumf pavla ubić ne traje dugo jer i on 1312. godine umire . već razočarani ban stjepan i kotromanić je umro neto prije 1314. godine , dakle skoro istovremeno kada i njegov ljuti protivnik . iza sebe je ostavio tri sina : stjepana , vladislava i ninoslava . u to vreme niko od njih nije boravio u bosni , budući da su se morali pred navalom ubića , ali po svemu sudeći i unutranjeg nezadovoljstva , skloniti u dubrovnik . `` kada je , dakle , posle smrti pomenutog bana stjepana njegov najstariji sin stjepan , saglasno sa svojom braćom , hteo preuzeti upravu u bosni , ustali su protiv njega svi najistaknutiji velikai toga kraljevstva i nisu ga prihvatili . na ovo ih nije navelo nita drugo sem to to su videli da su on i njegova braća veoma pametni i vezani između sebe , pa su se jako pobojali da ne bi kojim putem unitili slobodu i ukinuli zakone bosne . kad je stjepan video razjarenost velikaa , smatrao je da je u tom času najpametnije da im popusti i da se prilagodi vremenu , te da čeka da mu bog poalje neku drugu priliku da povrati očinsku dravu . zato se povukao sa svojom majkom jelisavetom u dubrovnik '' ( mavro orbin ) . za to vreme mladen ii ubić , koji se sada nazivao `` mladen , knez zadra , princip dalmacije i drugi ban bosanski '' , nikako nije uspevao da odri svoju vlast na svim onim teritorijama koje je nasledio od pavla ubića . najpre mu je iz ruku iskliznuo zadar koji se 1313. godine prepustio veneciji . to kao da je bio znak za sve nezadovoljnike da se pobune protiv njegove vladavine . u retrospektivi gledano , upravo je pad zadra bio uvod i u konačni slom moći mladena ii ubića . nekako su svi tada bili u ljutim nevoljama . dok je kuća ubića naletala na sve vie neprijatelja , kotromanići su doiveli gubitak budući da im je ban stjepan i kotromanić umro ( 1314 . ) , a umro je i njegov dotadanji stalni zatitnik `` sremski kralj '' , dragutin nemanjić . `` bi prestavljenje ovoga preblaenoga meseca marta dvadeset drugi dan , treće nedelje svete četrdesetnice u petak , u čas deveti i tako se raziđoe svako svojoj kući , slaveći i sina i sv . duha , sada i uvek i na vekove vekova . amin '' ( danilo drugi ) . smrt dragutinova je bila znak za njegovog brata , rakog kralja milutina da sa svojim trupama uđe u mačvu i zauzme je za sebe , a da dragutinovog sina vladislava baci u tamnicu . osim toga , pokuao je milutin , da zauzme i hum , ali tu je naleteo na bana mladena ii ubića , koji je takođe mislio da hum pripada njemu . to se do kraja izrodilo u oruane sukobe , a vojna dejstva su se odvijala u blizini dubrovnika . samo vojevanje je ilo jako loe po mladena ii ubića pa je do kraja morao pristati da se izmiri sa rakim kraljem milutinom i da mu svoga brata , grgura ubića , poalje kao taoca . grgura ubića i ostale taoce poslao je kralj milutin u dubrovnik i tu su oni boravili sve dok mladen ii ubić nije ispunio ono to je bilo ugovoreno .\n",

      "pred očima dubrovnika popadale su redom , u kratkom razmaku od nekih četrdeset godina , sve nae slobodne drave srbija , bosna , hercegovina , crna gora . četvrt veka samo iza njih bila je sruena i mađarska kraljevina . jedina je u tom optem brodolomu ostala poteđena mala dubrovačka republika . a ostala je poteđena ne samo zato , to je bila malecna i politički potpuno bezopasna , nego to je , prateći budno događaje , paljivo izbegavala da dade povoda za sukobe . njezini neprijatelji prebacivali su joj , da , iako je republika strogo katolička drava , u njezinoj politici nema nimalo prave hrićanske solidarnosti i da se ona stavlja u slubu turske i preko obaveza , koje se trae od jedne vazalne drave . u dubrovniku je , nesumnjivo , u dravnim poslovima razum uvek vladao nad osećanjem . toliko propovedana potreba hrićanske solidarnosti gurnula je poslednjeg bosanskog kralja u rat s turcima , ali se u sudbonosnom času ne nađe niko sa strane , da stradalniku priskoči u pomoć . mađarska , mezimac papske kurije , pala je isto tako ostavljena sama sebi . kroz rim su 1527. god . pustoile hrićanske čete gore nego da su bili turci . domalo moćne hrićanske drave , kao francuska , traiće savez s turcima . ta se onda moglo zameriti malom dubrovniku , to se nekom avanturističkom poduhvatom nije izloio sigurnoj i beskorisnoj propasti ? dubrovčani nisu bili nikakav politički činilac , niti su imali političkih ambicija . bili su , u glavnom , dobri trgovci , koji su u tenji da dobiju vie mogućnosti za rad traili stalno naslona na onu silu , koja je u izvesnom periodu pretstavljala glavnu snagu na balkanu . tako su do 1205 . god. , s malim prekidima , priznavali vrhovnu vlast vizantije ; od 1205-1358. bili su podlonici mletački , koji su im slali svoje plemiće za knezove ; od 1358-1526. stajali su pod zatitom ugarske . srpskim vladarima davali su za slobodnu trgovinu po njihovoj zemlji poklone u novcu i sviti , a od vremena uroa i uveden je stalni godinji danak od 2.000 perper , koji se od dragutinova vremena plaćao o mitrov-danu i s toga se zvao `` svetodimitarski dohodak '' . s turcima su dubrovčani stupili u veze od 1430. god . aljući im svoja poslanstva , a 1442. su dali zakletvu vernosti sultanu i poslali mu prvi godinji poklon u vrednosti od 1.000 dukata . po staroj lokalnoj legendi , koja je ula u knjievnost , dubrovnik je podigao mladi slovenski kraljević pavlimir , čiji su pretci zbog domaćih smutnja morali da bee u tuđinu i da se stane u rimu . otud se vratio , na poziv , mladi kraljević da savlada protivnike , povrati red i kao krunu rada podigne dubrovnik . kao to je nekad eneja , beeći iz troje , doao u italiju da njegovi potomci dignu rim i izvedu sintezu istoka i zapada , tako je , po ovoj legendarnoj kombinaciji , stigao i pavlimir iz rima , da stvori simbiozu romansko-slovenskog elementa i njegove kulture , toliko karakteristične za celo nae primorje . u stvari , dubrovnik je nastao iz dva naselja : slovenskog brdskog dubrovnika i romanskog raguziuma , koji se digao na malom ostrvu i koji su naselile izbeglice iz bliskog epidaura . dodir između slovena i romana bio je na tom području iv i neposredan , to jasno pokazuje veliki broj očuvanih romanskih naziva mesta , kao cavtat , konavle , brgat , roat , umet , bulet i sl . sloveni i romani zasuli su , posle izvesnog vremena uski morski kanal između grebena , zvanih penatura , kod dananjih pila i posle ceo stradun , i tako su stvorili zajednički grad dubrovnik-raguzium , raguza . i danas je jo očuvano ime starog slovenskog graca , koji je titio nekadanje slovensko naselje . dubrovnik se irio postepeno na račun susednog humskog i trebinjskog područja i plaćao je za zemljite i vinograde godinji najam , zvan mogori ( margarisium ) , od po 60 zlatnika humskim i trebinjskim vladarima . kao luka dubrovnik i njegov gru imaju svoj razvoj da zahvale jedino trgovini i izvozu iz njegova zaleđa , huma , travunije i rake , koji su se proirili na veći deo srbije i dobar deo bosne . u staro vreme glavna sredita dalmatinskog primorja u administrativnom i trgovačkom pogledu behu salona i narona ; epidaur , koliko se zna , nije imao većeg značaja . s toga je i razumljivo , to je legenda stvaranje dubrovnika vezana za jednog susednog slovenskog plemića , koji gospodari trebinjem . dubrovnik se razvio naročito od xii veka , posle trgovačkih ugovora sa nemanjom i banom kulinom . od xiii veka u njemu počinje prevlađivati slovenski elemenat . činovnitvo i poneki trgovci i zanatlije dolazili su u dubrovnik iz raznih mesta italije , a naročito iz mletaka ; gradska aristokratija osećala se kao romanska i negovala je tu kulturu ; ali je iroki puk bio preteno slovenski i u gradu i u njegovu području . već u xiv veku i kod aristokratije ima primetne slavizacije , a od xv veka grad u ogromnoj većini nosi slovensko obeleje . veliko veće republike donelo je 26. oktobra 1395. ovaj izvanredno vani zaključak : `` unapred niko iz krajeva gornje ili donje dalmacije niti iz ijednoga stranoga kraja ne moe se učiniti niti postati građanin dubrovnika , niti se učiniti niti potvrditi u velikom vijeću dubrovnika , nego je jedino malo vijeće slobodno da imenuje za građane dubrovnika one ili između onih koje grad dubrovnik dri i smatra za slovene , na načine i po običajima kojima su i dosad sloveni pravljeni i primani u građanstvo dubrovnika . '' u gradu se naročito cenila sloboda . njoj je dubrovnik zahvaljivao , mimo sve druge gradove primorja , svoj privredni i svoj kulturni procvat . mlečani su izvesno vreme s ljubomorom pratili njegove trgovačke veze , ali nisu uspeli da ih spreče , iako su to čeće * * * * pokuavali . istina , dubrovnik se trgovački digao sa mletačkim kapitalom . eksploataciju rudnika u srbiji i bosni , koja im je donela glavno bogatstvo , dubrovčani su mogli početi u većoj meri tek sa kreditima iz mletaka . titeći se od prepada i sa kopna i sa mora dubrovčani su opasali svoj grad sa u ono doba neosvojivim , odlično građenim bedemima , koji su i do danas očuvani . te gradske utvrde odravali su uvek u najboljem radu i bdili su u njima sa strogoću koja nije znala ni za kakve izuzetke . kad je u pitanju bila sloboda građani su se reavali i na veoma velike rtve . i trgovac je dobro razumevao da cena za slobodu nikad nije plaćena skupo . s toga je sloboda - libertas isticana kao glavni cilj cele dravne politike . `` ona se ne prodaje ni za sve zlato '' , pisalo je na gradskim bedemima ; njoj su ispevane i najoduevljenije pesme dubrovačke knjievnosti . kao i mletačka republika , prema kojoj je izgradila svoje uređenje , i dubrovnik je bio aristokratska republika . na njenom čelu nalazili su se do 1358. god . mletački plemići , iz ponajboljih kuća , sa mandatom od dve godine dana . ostale vlasti bile su dubrovačke . svi punoletni plemići sačinjavali su veliko veće ; njihov najveći broj iznosio je 1319. god . 241 člana . izvrnu vlast imalo je malo veće , koje je s knezom zajedno brojalo 12 članova . veće umoljenih ( consilium rogatorum ) s nejednakim brojem članova ( od 45-60 ) , u stvari senat , stvaralo je `` po pravilu zakone i sve vanije odredbe u unutranjim i spoljanjim poslovima '' . velik ugled imalo je svetenstvo , koje je na području dubrovačke republike bilo isključivo katoličko . najstariji red bili su benediktinci , koji su osnovali svoj veliki manastir na lokrumu . franjevci i dominikanci podigli su svoje manastire blizu dva jedina izlaza iz grada ; prvi na pilama , a drugi na pločama . oni su tako simbolički bili neka vrsta gradske strae , duhovne i fizičke . kroz te dve kapije nije sve do xix veka prola nikad nijedna tuđinska vojska kao osvajač . imajući potpunu svoju samoupravu , ne postradavi nikad i ni od koga u svom gradu , dubrovčani su se osetno dizali . u gradu se postepeno gomilalo bogatstvo , koje je donosila trgovina po balkanu i sa lepom trgovačkom flotom po celom sredozemnom moru . moe se sasvim dobro pratiti po trgovačkim obračunima , po mirazima i testamentima u gradskim knjigama kako se u dubrovačkim porodicama mnoe predmeti od srebra , skupih tkanina i bogatije pokućstvo . sa srbijom su odnosi od xiv veka vrlo srdačni , jer najveći deo tamonjih rudnika dre dubrovački trgovci bilo sami , bilo kao ortaci . u brskovu , rudniku , trepči , novom brdu i po drugim mestima njihove su kolonije bile vrlo jake . od 1325. god . imali su dubrovčani u srpskom kraljevstvu i svoj pravi konzulat , a konzula je , s uim delokrugom , bilo već od kraja xiii veka . posle se konzuli javljaju i u drugim zemljama susedstva , s kojima je trgovački promet postajao sve intenzivniji . s materialnim blagostanjem dizalo se i duhovno . mladi plemići dobijali su vaspitanje ne samo u svom gradu , nego mnogi i u italiji . grad , istina , nije imao nekih viih kola , ali se trudio da dobavlja dobre učitelje . pozivani su učitelji i za slovensku pismenost , i to ne samo za dubrovnik , nego i za ston . crkvena umetnost razvijala se lepo . graditeljstvo , u romanskoj tradiciji , ima nekoliko objekata nesumnjive vrednosti . divona , očuvana do danas , sa lepom lođom romanskog stila i vrlo ukusim prozorima podignuta je xiv veka . u to vreme , naročito u prvoj polovini xiv veka , bili su u gradu u modi prozori `` saracenski '' , uobičajeni po obalama june italije i panije . lepi kneev dvor , rađen s puno ukusa i paljivo , dovren je 1425. god . u dananjem svom obliku potiče , s preradama , iz 1462 . nemamo , na alost , bliih podataka o dve glavne dubrovačke crkve , onoj gospe i sv . vlaha , poto su obe stradale za vreme velikog zemljotresa od 1667 . god. , pa su obnovljene tek početkom xviii veka . crkva sv . spasa dovrena je 1520 . god. , ali se nije računala među najreprezentativnije građevine . mnogo se polagalo i na crkveno slikarstvo . sama vlada je već krajem xiv veka pomagala umetnike sa strane stavljajući im u dunost , da poučavaju i po nekog dubrovčanina . tako je , na pr. , 1389. god . data plata `` grčkom slikaru '' majstoru jovanu iz drača ; 1390. sklopljen je ugovor sa slikarem stojkom drukovićem , očevidno nekim naim čovekom ; a bilo je slikara i iz italije i ugarske . zgrade pojedinih plemića bile su pune umetničkih predmeta , ali ponajvie tuđih . lepo se razvila kod nas zlatarska umetnost i njeni predmeti su sluili često i za izvoz , ali prvenstveno na balkan . dananji izgled dubrovačkih zgrada i ulica potiče mahom iz xvii veka , posle pomenutog stranog zemljotresa . kuće su kamene , solidne , sa po tri-četiri sprata , ali bez naročitih ukrasa . ulice su tipično talijansko-primorske , uske i mračne . sve manje-vie vode sa stepenicama prema bregu , jer je prostor straduna i pijace vrlo teskoban za pravi razvoj grada . kuće izvan gradskih zidina dizane su visoko na podnoju susednih bregova i do njih se ide uz mnogobrojne i prilično strme stepenice ( u gradu za to postoji izraz `` čini skale '' ) . u samom gradu , gde se iskorićavalo svako slobodno mesto , ima vrlo malo bata i zelenila , nego je sve gusto i zbijeno . malo daha daju kućama terase i poneko vrlo usko dvorite . izvesni nai ljudi iz unutranjosti dolazili su preko dubrovnika i njegovih ljudi u dodir sa zapadnom kulturom . neki su se tu i vaspitavali , kao bala sin đurđa stracimirovića , ili kao neki bosanski plemići ( n. pr . brailo tezalovi & # 263 . iz dubrovnika su se , u priličnim količinama , izvozile u nae zemlje razne vrste svite , brokata , kadife , i drugih skupocenih materija , koje su se sviđale naoj srednjevekovnoj vlasteli . dubrovčani su učili nau unutranjost i raskonijoj hrani i piću , malvasiji , junom voću i raznim mirođijama . bogat je bio izvoz boljeg oruja , posuđa i lepeg nakita . da su nai ljudi već xv veka poznavali material i da se nisu dali lako prevariti svedoči najbolje slučaj hercega stepana , koji je izazvao spor sa dubrovačkim trgovcima zbog lanih kamenova mesto diamanata na jednom platu . iz unutranjosti se izvozila stoka , stočni proizvodi , vosak i od kraja xiii veka naročito rude : olovo , bakar i srebro . dubrovnik je imao veliku i dobru trgovačku flotu i na nju je bio naročito ponosit . njena aktivnost datira iz ix veka i bila je veća nego ijednog drugog grada dalmacije . tada su njihove lađe prevozile slovenske ratnike u junu italiju i činile i tad i posle ne malih usluga vizantiskoj carevini . dok se nalazio pod mletačkom vrhovnom vlaću mlečani nisu sprečavali razvoj dubrovačke trgovačke mornarice , ali su im postali opasni protivnici , kad je mali grad pod sv . srđem priao mađarima , njihovom glavnom i vekovnom protivniku o posed dalmacije . u svom naponu dubrovnik je imao preko 300 velikih lađa . kao neka pomorska `` sila '' dubrovčani su kao s pravom teili da proire svoju vlast i na susedna ostrva , pa su postepeno pridobili sem susednih malih otoka , jo lastovo , mljet i korčulu , a iva im je elja bila da se dočepaju brača i hvara . kad su 1333. god . dobili ston , a 1426. god . konavlje javila se u republici tenja da svoju `` dravu '' proire i novim dobitcima . jedno vreme mnogo su radili da dobiju trebinje . turska osvajanja razbila su sve te elje i osvestila su ih , da ne idu preko granica svoje moći . od četrdesetih godina xv veka dubrovčani se predaju samo razvoju svoje trgovine i svoje flote , i to im je donelo , bez mnogo potresa , vrlo krupne rezultate . dubrovački pesnici s ponosom su u xvi veku govorili , da je njihova mornarica `` gospoja i kraljica svijeh mrnara na sem svijeti '' i čestit se svak nahodi i čas mu je prevelika vjeran ivot tko provodi pod bandijerom dubrovnika . veze sa svetom , blagostanje , razvoj duhovnog ivota izazvali su u dubrovniku i stvaranje knjievnosti . izvestan deo naih ljudi , koje su elja za naukama ili razni slučajevi odveli u tuđinu , istakli su se dosta rano svojim uspesima , pa su neki posredno i neposredno uticali i na ljude u otadbini . među njima su bili čuveni teolozi , kao , n . pr. , serafim bunić ili grgur natali budislavić , ili pravnici kao raguzio de raguzens , ili ekonomisti kao benko kotruljić . jo vie su delovali primeri tada već razvijene talijanske knjievnosti , koja je imala dantea i petrarku i čitav niz drugih pesnika velikog talenta . sem toga , dubrovčani su bili u ivim vezama i sa ostalim gradskim sredinama po dalmaciji i ostrvima , gde su se , isto tako , pod zapadnim uticajima stvarale knjievne kole . iz severne dalmacije doao je tako u knjievnu upotrebu dubrovačku čakavski dialekat , iako su ceo grad i njegova okolica bili čisti tokavci . prvi dubrovački pisci počeli su svoj rad na latinskom jeziku . prvi dubrovački `` ovenčani pesnik '' ( poeta laureatus ) bio je petar menčetić , a najistaknutiji pesnik latinista bee ilija lampridije cerva , pravi pretstavnik savremenog humanističkog pokreta . prvi pesnici na narodnom jeziku behu prilično neobuzdani iko menčetić i đore drić , obojica čisti liričari i obojica poslednici petrarkine pesničke kole . kod drića je , mimo običaja tih vremena , bilo i neto uticaja nae narodne lirske poezije , koja se s njim prvi put javlja kao umetnički činilac u naoj knjievnosti . popularan je postao sa svojom jeđutkom , zanimljivom lirskom pesmom andrija čubranović , koji je stvorio obrazac za vie sličnih pokuaja . pobonu , političku i `` remetsku '' poeziju negovao je čudnjak mavro vetranović , koji je pevao i crkvene drame , sve sa izvesnim pesničkim osećanjem , ali bez imalo umetničke mere . među svim tim knjievnicima , koji su rođeni u drugoj polovini xv veka , a radili u prvoj polovini xvi , najveći talenat pokazao je marin drić , knjievnik od ređe vrednosti . on se ogledao u vie knjievnih rodova , ali glavna mu je snaga u komediji , u kojoj je pokazao i invencije , i duha , i dobar posmatrački dar , i u kojoj je dao nekoliko dobro pogođenih tipova i scena iz savremenog dubrovačkog drutva . od sredine xvi veka dubrovačka knjievnost razvija se sve vie i obilatije ; stvara odličnu liriku , dramu s naročito uspelom lokalnom komedijom , i irok ep . jedino to nije uspela da razvije do većeg stepena bila je umetnička proza . u celoj naoj sredini , među srbima i hrvatima , nijedan drugi grad nije mogao da se meri po knjievnom stvaranju sa dubrovnikom , ni u pogledu količine stvaranja , ni po njegovoj vrednosti . kad je 1526. god . pala mađarska drava pred dubrovnikom je stajao samo izbor između mletaka i turske kao vrhovnih gospodara . iako hrićani , mlečani im nisu bili blii srcu . dubrovnik je bio trgovački toliko razvijen , da bi mleci , u sopstvenom interesu , kao konkurenti , morali da mu kode . tursko susedstvo i turska vrhovna vlast , znalo se , neće biti laki . ali im turci , koji nikad nisu bili dobri trgovci , nisu ni mogli ni hteli poslovno smetati . naprotiv . oni su dali dubrovčanima , kao svojim haračarima , povlaćen poloaj u celom svom prostranom carstvu , otvorili im sve svoje pijace , i ostavili im potpuno slobodne ruke u unutranjim poslovima i svima drugim vezama . godinji danak koji su plaćali sultanu ustaljen je bio od 1481. god . na 12.500 dukata i republici , koja se razvijala u punoj meri , ta obaveza sve do kraja xvi veka nije padala teko . kada se imala da odluči kome da pristupi republika se nije mnogo kolebala i već iste , 1526 . god. , priznala je sultana kao vrhovnog gospodara . nije kakav svetovni dravnik ili trgovac , nego je ba jedan svetenik , i to pesnik , mavro vetranović , smatrao za patriotsku dunost da svom gradu savetuje ovakvu politiku : s bogom se ti zdrui i mimo sve ino i dvori i slui otmansko kolino ! da nije doneo takvu odluku dubrovnik bi , vrlo verovatno , ili bio pokoren ili bi , opkoljen turcima sa svih kopnenih strana , imao vrlo mnogo da strada . grad je imao hrićanskog saosećanja ; u njemu se i kroz knjievnost i inače davalo ponekad , iako oprezno , izraza bolu zbog teke hrićanske sudbine , ali se čuvala svoja koa . turskoj sili nije bilo brane . zavađani i ljuto međusobno zakrvavljeni hrićani , koje je već počeo da razdvaja protestantski pokret i nove krize s njim u vezi , nije je mogao da stvori . mlečani ponajmanje . i otkle ste postali vi nijeste dosada orujem prijali ni sela ni grada , poručuje im dubrovački pesnik i ljutito i nedvosmisleno . naprotiv . na njih `` uzdie poglavje krstjansko '' , jer njihova nevera vaj , mnogu gospodu u rasap rastjera da izgube slobodu . uostalom , ako već mlečani osećaju da imaju snage da nekog spasavaju i tite , nek se obrnu prema istoku , nek brane kipar i povrate carigrad , a dubrovnik nek ostave njegovom udesu . on je naao svoj put i ne samo u ondanjim prilikama , nego sve do kraja xviii veka , on se nikad nije pokajao to je tako učinio .\n",

      "jos nesto o zhidovima u srbiji- ( `` srbija je za njih ostala , ,zemlja svinjara i mečkara ’ ’ , karađorđe i miloš su za njih bili i ostali , ,obični svinjarski trgovci ’ ’ , a srpski narod jedan , ,inferioran narod ’ ’ . ) - do 1900 godine jevreji nisu bili s nama , niti su bili s nama do 1914 . najgnusnije stvari protiv srbije i srba napisane u bečkoj i berlinskoj štampi i između 1894 ( prvi april ) i 1914 potekle su iz jevrejskog pera . srpska vlada je trošila milione i milione dinara ( u zlatu ) da ih , ,ućutka ’ ’ ili omekne ali u tome nije uspela . srbija je za njih ostala , ,zemlja svinjara i mečkara ’ ’ , karađorđe i miloš su za njih bili i ostali , ,obični svinjarski trgovci ’ ’ , a srpski narod jedan , ,inferioran narod ’ ’ . što je najinteresantnije , jevreji nisu ( sve do 1918 ) , uopšte ni pridavali značaj srpskom jeziku . oni su među sobom govorili španski , grčki , nemački i t.d . i bacali su se srpskim padežima tako da je bilo dovoljno da zinu , pa da se vidi ko su i šta su . taj njihov nozalni žargon je sasvim iščezao tek pre desetak godina , ali kad jevreji pišu oni i danas greše u padežima i nekim glagolskim konstrukcijama na tipično svoj način . za vreme prošlog evropskog rata jevreji su jednim vrlo malim delom prihvatali stvar srbije kao svoju stvar , ali je jevrejska masa sebe opet ogradila od te stvari . jevreji su sa austrijskim okupatorskim vlastima kolaborisali najsrdačnije , radeći protiv srba , i ističući svoje izdvajanje iz srpskoga bloka . oni su se zato za vreme prošle okupacije toliko bogatili da su se sa jalije i jereka raširili po celom beogradu . ubacili svoju decu u gimnazije i druge škole i spremali onu svoju inteligenciju , koja će posle 1920 napraviti prvi nalet na sve naše pozive , otimajući sva lekarska , inžinjerka i druga mesta srbima , čiji su se dedovi borili uz vožda i kodža miloša , i docnije za svoju nacionalnu državu . ojačani jevrejskim elementom iz drugih delova jugoslavije , jevreji su tako združeni , monopolisali posle 1918 godine za sebe drvarsku i ne znam koju još industriju , novčarstvo , spoljnu ( izvoz i uvoz ) trgovinu , sva posredništva i sve lukrativne poslove . da bi se obračunali sa srbima kao izjvažnijom grupom oni su proglasili najbolje srpske privrednike i političare , za grke , cincare i korupcionaše i tako su stvorili mito , ,beogradskoj čaršiji ’ ’ , oglašavajući je za ruglo i nesreću jugoslavije , premda je čekmedže davno bilo u njihovim rukama , i samo u njihovim rukama , a ljudi mihailovog tipa su davno ležali u svojim grobnicama , ako im potomci nisu bili prinuđeni da i te grobnice , ,ustupe ’ ’ novim ratnim bogatašima . tako se još jednom potvrdila ona stara : , ,povika na vuka , a lisice meso jedu ’ ’ . ko bude pisao istoriju jugoslavije on bo morao da se osvrne na ona velika jevrejska vršljanja po toj zemlji bez nacionalne , socionalne i privredne policije , u kojoj su jevreji posle 1930 godine počeli da vode prvu reč u štampi ( iza kulisa ili direktno ) , služeći se sad već i srodničkim vezama sa srbima , koje su upecali da se sa njima srode . uglavnom jevreji su pomagali svaku demokratsku stvar u jugoslaviji , a naročito su to činili oni , ,iz ireka ’ ’ i jevrejska omladina sva listom , koja je pomagala svaki separatistički pokret , sce što je destruktivno uopšte . šta više jevreji su finansirali čitave stranke , kao što su , ,navodadžirali ’ ’ kad će ko od njihovih eksponenata ući u koju vladu i u koji resor , – gde je naravno imao da svršava njihove jevrejske stvari . i dok su tako jevreji sa jedne strane zadržavali položaj dvorskog lekara , uvlačili se u diplomatiju pa čak i u vojsku , odnosno u oficirski kor , ( kroz sanitet i rezervu ) , dok su grabili sve rudnike , sve banke i sve fabrike u svoje ruke , dotle su sa druge strane stupali u sve ilegalne organizacije i sve moguće krugove , odatle su mogli da ruše , ,diktaturu ’ ’ kralja aleksandra , poredak i red u zemlji . ali jevreji su to radili na fin način : kao trgovački agenti i , ,zastupnici ’ ’ koji zgrću milione i milione i koji drže , ,otvorene kuće ’ ’ i daju političke večere kao inspiratori dopisnika evropske i američke štampe , koji su takođe bili jevreji , kao snobovi koji žive po banjama u zemlji i na strani , ogovarajući i kritikujući jugoslaviji , kao ljudi kojima su jugoslovenski razdori išli na ruku da se domognu predominantnog položaja u privredi zemlje . i u tome su zbilja uspeli . domogli su se svega što im je palo za oko . uspeli su toliko da je 120.000 jevreja u jugoslaviji živelo kao bubreg u loju . oni nisu imali ni neuposlene , ni nepismene ni neobezbeđene , ili socijalno neuposlene , ni nepismene ili neobezbeđene , ili socijalno nezbrinute dok je u jugoslaviji bilo šesdeset procenata nepismenih , pedeset procenata socijalno nezbrinutih . oni su imali svoje bolnice , svoje penzione fondove , svoja dobrotvorna društva , svoje potporne družine itd . nisu oni kao neki ljudi , kapetan miša , gazda ilija milosavljević-kolarac , dimitrije stamenković , luka ćelović i , ,tuti kvanti ’ ’ ostavljali svoja imanja srpstvu ! ne , nego su ih zaveštali jevrejskoj veroispovednoj zajednici ! ali su zato jevreji ipak sedeli čak i u upravnom odboru društva sv . save i otuda sa zanosom izvikivali : , ,brat je mio koje vere bio ’ ’ . u sebi su u stvari mislili , ,bratstvo za bratstvo , a sir za pare ’ ’ ! … u čaršiji su izigravali srbe mojsijeve vere i poneki od starijih jevreja čak i verovao u tu formulu i u to rešenje , radeći svoje poslove i neinteresujući se za politiku , u javnosti su bili , ,jugosloveni ’ ’ a ne srbi . poneki od njih je bio trgovac i samo trgovac . njega nije bolela ni srpska , a kamo li jugoslovenska stvarnost . mi smo 1919 imali u jugoslaviji više vrsta jevreja . oni su se delili na sefarde i eškenaze , na srpske , mađarske , nemačke , ruske i t.d . jevreje , zatim na jevreje iz srbije , na jevreje iz vojvodine , iz bosne , i južne srbije i t.d . ovi poslednji apsolutno nisu hteli ni minuta da se solidarišu sa srbima , odnosno sa jugoslovenima . desetak hiljada je iz prištine i bitolja otišlo u ameriku . da su se osećali kao jugosloveni , odnosno kao srbi , oni bi svakako ostali kod nas , ili bar tamo u americi rekli da su srbi ili jugosloveni . ne , oni se nisu hteli solidarisati sa nama , oni u americi nisu ni trenutka više govorili o kakvoj srbiji ili jugoslaviji . nekulturni ti jugoslovenski jevreji videli su da ne mogu izaći na kraj sa nama . u turskoj ih nisu hteli , u grčkoj još manje . u palestinu oni sami nisu hteli . u ameriku su otišli odma kao kad prnu vrapci . jesu li bar njihovi ostaci u bitolju danas srbi mojsijeve vere ? je su li bitoljski jevreji nastanjeni u beogradu , sada srbi ? reći će se : pa to je apsurd . naravno da je to apsurd , a i mi to hoćemo da kažemo . apsurd je zaista kada se danas i mađarski , i nemački , i ruski i svi drugi jevreji po beogradu , ,krste ’ ’ kao srbi mojsijeve vere . jer šta bi smo onda radili sa jevrejima koji su ateisti , koji uopšte otvoreno vele , ,religionslos ’ ’ ( t. j. bezvernici ) i koji uopšte ne idu ni u kakvu versku kategoriju ? najzad , šta će mo sa onim jevrejima koji danas govore samo srpski , ali koji imaju pored srpskog još uvek i tursko , brazilijansko ili ko zna koje podanstvo ? ima u beogradu , na primer , vrlo uglednih jevrejskih porodica koje su tek 1939 ili 1940 došle do jugoslovenskog podanstva iako žive i rade sto godina među nama ! čarapari eliasi su tako bili grčki podanici sve do pred kraj ovog rata , a danas žele da prođu kao ak-srbi . za vreme prošle okupacije , kad su mogli slobodno i nesmetano da rade svoje trgovačke poslove , oni se nisu solidarisali sa srbima , a sada hoće da se srbi solidarišu sa njima , zato što današnji okupator neće da radi sa jevrejima . obrnuto , kada bi današnja nemačka htela da sa njima radi oni bi se i danas odmah desolidarisali sa srbima , a pošto nemačka to neće , srbi znači treba da se solidarišu sa jevrejima ! ? za vreme prošlog rata jevreja nije bilo ni u boldogisanju ni u nežideru , i onda za njih to je bilo dobro , danas kad je u prisustvu jedan drugi okupator , koji neće da zna za jevreje , svi su jevreji uzeli masku srba mojsijeve vere i svi žele da se srpski narod po svaku cenu solidariše sa njima . zašto ? radi čega da se solidariše . srpski narod neće sa njima da se solidariše . a to neće iz više razloga . prvi razlog je u tome što su ti isti jevreji jako izišli iz svoje uloge kad su počeli da rade protiv nemačke , pa su i nas doveli do 27 marta i 6 aprila o. g. drugi razlog je u tome što su sami jevreji jugoslavije odmah posle 1919 prihvatili cinizam i uzeli za sebe položaj i prava meteka , dakle poslovnih stranaca u našoj zemlji , a ne ulogu njenih sinova . treći razlog je u tome što se i među srbima javio jedan autoktoni antisemitski pokret , koji su jevreji pre 6 aprila 1941 nekad vešto , nekad silom ugušivali , jer su finansiski i na druge načine bili u jugoslaviji tako jaki da su mogli uticati na vlast kako su hteli . taj antisemitizam je nikao iz razloga koji su gore opisani , i on nema veze sa nemačkim okupatorom . nije , dakle , okupator doneo to sobom , nego su za taj srpski antisemitizam jevreji sami krivi , pošto se radi o jednoj samonikloj srpskoj stvari . srbi neće da se solidarišu sa jevrejima i to je isto tako prirodno kao što jevreji nisu hteli da se solidarišu sa srbima ni 1804 , ni 1813 , ni 1862 , ni 1875 , ni 1879 ni od 1894 do 1918 . jer su se jevreji solidarisali sa nama kad su 1940 počeli da finansiraju kampanje i izazivanja protiv nemačke i kad smo ih mi molili : , ,nemojte ! nemačka je jaka . ona nas ne dira . nije to dobro ni za vas , ni za nas ! ’ ’ … ili su se solidarisali sa nama 27 marta kad su pali u tako histeričan bes i počeli da da urliču po beogradskim ulicama : , ,bolje rat , nego pakt ’ ’ ! – i ako su znali da nije tačno da je bolji rat nego pakt , i da to uverenje vodi raspadu jugoslavije i novoj golgoti srpskoga naroda . ili su se valjda jevreji solidarisali sa srbima kad su besumično urlikali : , ,bolje grob nego rob ! ’ ’ – prevrnuvši u svom jevrejskom neznanju srpsku poslovicu : , ,robom ikad , grobom nikad ’ ’ , radeći samo na tome da bi srbi sami sebi iskopali grob , doprinoseći u borbi izrailja za njegov opstanak svoje žrtve ? treba se zapitati : kopogibe od tih slavnih jevreja , antihitlerovaca hukača po pravoshodstvu , kojih je bilo u tolikom broju u jugoslovenskoj vojsci ? ko je od njih udario na nemački tenk i ko je položio život za jugoslaviju ? ko je od njih isečen kao rajić na topu ili je odleteo kao sinđelić u čegru ? … svi su oni i danas živi i zdravi u oficirskim ili vojničkim logorima za zarobljenike ako se ne nalaze na primorju kao , ,rekovalescenti ’ ’ ili bogati turisti , kojima je čudno da se jugoslavija tako brzo raspala i da se srbi nisu borili bar godinu dana ! ali baš zato sto se nisu borili , danas srbe treba zavaditi sa okupatorima da svi izginu , da se zatre jedna pogana rasa , rasa koja nije shvatila povezanost svoga i jevrejskog interesa , odnosno interes jevreja u ovome istoriskom trenutku . lane , 1940 godine jevreji su dreknuli kao besumučni na đenerala nedića što nekom alkalaju i drugima nije hteo da polažu oficirski ispit . onda su se busali u grudi , zalažući se da će svi izginuti za jugoslaviju , za srbiju , za svoju , ,majku otadžbinu ’ ’ , samo da im se dadu oficirske epolete , plate i povlastice , a kad je došao 6 april , oni su svi automobilima povrvili k moru , čekajući tamo ishod borbe koju su srbi vodili sa nemačkom ! šta mi to onda toliko dugujemo jevrejima da se moramo solidarisati sa njima ? to je pitanje na koje treba da nam odgovore naši nadri-patrioti , fascinirani ili opijeni jevrejskim sugestijama . mi im ne dugujemo apsolutno ništa . njih 120 hiljada je u jugoslaviji imalo životni standard tako visok da su kao konsomenti bili važniji činilac nego 2,000.000 muslimana skupa ili 2,000.000 srba ili drugih prosečnih jugoslovena uzetih na gomilu . da li je njih 120.000 medjutim privređivalo toliko koliko 2,000.000 onih drugih nesrećnika to je pitanje na koje se odgovara samo sa ne , ne i ne ! pa otkud onda mi treba danas da se apsolutno solidarišemo sa , ,srbima mojsijeve vere ? ’ ’ o kakvom onda solidarisanju srba sa jevrejima ne može biti ni reči . srbima je danas teško oko grla , da bi mogli pomagati i kome drugome no sebi . oni zato nastoje da odvoje svoju stvar od jevrejske stvari . jer , srbi neće , apsolutno neće da ginu , za jevrejske ideale , a još manje žele da nose odgovornost za jevrejske sabotaže u okupiranoj srbiji ! srbi žele samo jedno : da samostalno žive svoju sudbinu , da budu individualni narod u svojim radostima i patnjama , narod koji se razočarao i u sebi bližima nego što su jevreji , narod umoran od političkih ortakluka i bratstava koji su ga doveli do današnjeg razočarenja i današnjeg stanja . srbi time ne žele da pogoršaju ničiju sudbinu , ali oni neće da se identifikuju ni sa kim . pošto su srbi narod od reči , pošten narod – a jevreji to nisu , srbi žele da se suoče sa bogom i svojom stvarnošću , sami kao od majke rođeni , ostavljajući svakome drugom da radi za sebe kako najbolje zna i ume . srpski narod i jevreji se moraju odvojiti , a srbi su svesni da to nije u interesu jevreja , pošto se ovi do danas nisu mogli na srbe požaliti ; obrnuto , srbi su ti koji mogu da se požale na jevreje i koji apsolutno neće sa jevrejima i to ne pod pritiskom nemaca , nego po zahtevu logike . to mora da se zna i da se primi kao osnovna dogma nove srpske politike i novoga srpskoga kursa . od te dogme srbi neće da odstupaju , niti hoće da menjaju svoj kurs , pošto se kod srba iskristalisalo uverenje , duboko i neizmenljivo , da su jevreji krivi što se srpski narod našao u oprečnosti sa rajhom – što je bilo od fatalnih posledica za srbe sve i svuda ! dr. lazar prokic ( 1941 )\n",

      "mmmmmda ... i onda će za par godina i oni govoriti hrvatskim jezikom , postati hrvati , i pričati sve najgore o srbima . već sad pomalo pizdekaju , a di je tek kad se počmu dokazivat po utakmicama ili skinhead grupama ... oni će bit eći od hrvata ne razumem kako si doao do tog zaključka . kako se iz činjenice da je jo uvek iv stari hrvatski , zaključuje da je sad ovo hrvatski jezik kojim piemo ? pa nije bugarski .. gramatika je protohrvatska i većina riječi ... 1 . glagoljica se ne moe vezati isključivo za hrvate . ona se prostire i do moravske i do čeke , na jugu čak do makedonije , a glagoljični spisi pronađeni su i u ruskom novgorodu . pored toga , glagoljica je pismo kojim su se , pored ostalih , sluili i srbi . 2 . o rukopisima - evo nekih starih ćiriličnih rukopisa , ako si na to mislio : . a o čemu govore ti glagoljični spisi koje pominje , o hrvatskoj , ili čemu drugom ? da li je moguće da su neke od tih spisa pisali srbi ? 1. kako je ila priča o ćirilici : dva grka ili bugara ( ta već ) ćiril i metodije su dola na izučavanje zanata na krk i tamo su se upoznali s pismom hrvata : starom glagoljicom pa su dva momka ubrzo shvatila da je glagoljica kao pismo idealno za pisanje slavenskog jezika , to se desilo na krku jer je tad krk bio glavni centar hrvatske kulture u to vrijeme ... a tu su bile velike knjinice s knjigama na glagoljici .. i jasno da su se i srpski popovi dolazili kolovati na krk , no nitko nije ponio glagoljicu sa sebom kao pismo , a ako su se dolazili kolovati sigurno da su morali prepisat koju knjigu . 2 . glagoljica je hrvatsko pismo i to puno prije ćirilice i ona je bila temelj na kojemu se ćirilica bazirala , jer ćirilica je glagoljica s ubačenim elementima grčkog alfabeta , a ćiril i metodije su pronjeli ćirilicu kao pismo prvo po srbiji i bugarskoj pa onda sve do sjevera . glagoljicu je zamjenila postupno latinica , nije bilo razdoblje ćirilice , ta govori da se kulturna razmjena nije događala nakon crkvenog raskola . 3 . o jeziku june srbije - mani se priča o `` proto bugarskom '' . taj jezik prvobitnih bugara treba traiti tamo gde se njihova teritorija i nalazila - dakle rusija , reon volge . oni su jo tamo bili slovenizirani , to jest primili ruski jezik . kada su , predvođeni kanom asparuhom , prodrli na istočni balkan , zatekli su tamo slovenska plemena , preciznije srpska ( mogu i nazive pruiti ako je potrebno , sad ih se ne sećam ) , koja su podlegla pritisku i pretrpela bugarizaciju . dakle , samo moe jezik bugara biti sličan srpskom , ili ruskom , nikako obrnuto . 4 . a ovo čime se sad sluimo ti i ja - kreirao je i uobličio upravo vuk . samo to ti pie latinicom , uz primese ijekavice , a ja ćirilicom , tokavskim naglaskom . upravo to spada u narečja srpskog jezika . to svako dete uči ovde iz gramatike . 3. moda se nismo dobro razumjeli .. kad sam govorio o tom protubugarskom mislio sam na makedonski , poto su ta dva jezika slična dao sam prednost bugarima a ne makedoncima jer vi srbi jednostavno ne priznate makedoniju .. no to je taj jezik o kojemu govorimo . 4 . vuk je daleko kasnije bio od kad su bile osnovne kole i unverziteti u hrvatskoj .. mi nismo imali potrebe za opismenjivanjem pastira jes mo uvijek imali dovoljno seoskih filozofa koji su bili ministranti .. prije su crkve u selima vrile opismenjavanje i dječaci su uglavnom bili ministranti ( pomagači popu ) te bi tako učili , svaki pop je imao obavezu opismenjavati narod , tako da tip kao vuk je bio viak ... a kako sam ti objasnio da hrvati imaju veliku kulturnu ostavtinu sama logika stvari govori da je hrvatski jezik bio dominantni jezik na ovim prostorima , vi srbi ste taj jezik primali u zemunu i ostalim graničnim gradovima . uđimo malo u gaće tih ljudi : srbija je bila moravska , kosovo i dio makedonije i tu su se mjeali razni jezici od albanskog , bugarskog , ilirskog , grčkog i sama logika kae da se hrvatski jezik proirio obrazovanjem , jer hrvati su bili jedini narod u europi koji je pisao knjige i vodio mise na materinjem jeziku .. to je bila kulturna asimilacija ... srbi su imali mise na grčkom ( kurca nisu kuili isto ko vabe koji su sluali mise na latinskom ) dok su hrvati krstili i vodili mise na hrvatskom .. zato je hrvatski tako rairen jer je bila borba između dvije crkve za vjernike , zato su hrvati imali te ogromne privilegije ( to je u ono vrijeme bilo hereza ) jer su davali rezultate ... hrvati su krenuli iz dalmacije i bosne a zauzeli su prostor cijelog balkana svojom kulturnom asimilacijom ... va jezik srpski jest hrvatski i nemate se ta ljutit , to je onda bilo tako bugari su proteklih 10 godina proveli po buvljacima june srbije , prodajući sve i svata za po `` ednu črvenu '' . osim sofije , i primorskog dela ( koji je neuporediv s jadranom ) , nema ba ničega . mali broj onih koji su se nakrali i ne znaju ta će s parama , ogroman broj turaka i cigana , a običan narod jedva spaja kraj s krajem . u centru sofije za 5 evra moe boga oca da pojede i popije . sva ironija evropske unije vidi se na primeru bugarske ( a i mađarske , moram reći ) . u hrvatskoj je trenutno potpora za ulazak u eu oko 20 % .. koliko je u srbiji ?

davalo se bre za to kosovo i akom i kapom , od plata radnika u ostalom delu srbije , odvajao se mesečni izdatak koji je iao na kosmet . mnogo je učinjeno za iptare u tom vremenu . oni su beali kako su stigli iz albanije , na volovskim zapragama su dolazili u srbiju , da bi im komunjare davale kuće ( prethodno oduzete od srba naravno ) , i poslove . tito je bio kum svakom desetom kopiletu tamo . nema leba tu . ja se nadam da ćemo mi to počistiti potpuno kada nam se prui prilika jednom za svagda , jer drugog reenja nema koliko ja znam srbi koji su bili na kosovu dobijali su dodatnu plaću ... a albanci da su dobijali kuće malo sam tu skeptičan to bi mogla bit miloevićeva priča za malu djecu .... albanci su dovođeni na kosovo da budu slabo plaćena radna snagu u rudnicima lignita i to je običaj jo od kraljevine shs ( kralj se kurčio po britanskom dvoru kako ima albansko roblje ) a dobro znam da je jugoslovensko-albanska granica bila najjače čuvana granica čak se komunjare nisu bojale taljana i njihovih sranja oko promorja koliko samih albanaca , tako da su albanci dolazili tek tako na kosovo i ivjeli u srpskim kućama ne stoji nikako .. ta granica je bila najjebenija granica u europi . ruskopoljskiidov tito je bio kum svakom 10 djetetu u yu .. to je običaj svih vladara ... albanci su redovito imali 10 toro djece ..... a pogodi zato ? zato ta je plaća albanca u rudniku bila mala puno manja nego jednog srbina supovca , zato je albanac morao imati dosta djece tako da s 4 plaće bi mogao preivljavat ... a koliko znamo albanci nisu imali ni dosta poljoprivrednog zemljita da se mogu prehranit . strpali ste ih u getoe , oni su se nakotili i sad se pitate kako ... i ta ćete napravit ... nemoete nita napravit osim ako vi tamo ne počmete se naseljavat i raditi 20 djece .. no vidit ćete da će sad broj djece na kosovu naglo opast čim se digne malo standard\n",

“ odmah po objavljivanju vesti o grafitima na spomen domu ( uz obaveznu netačnu tvrdnju o „ četiri ćirilična slova ” umesto o četiri ocila ) , naime , juče su krenule oštre reakcije sve do samog državnog vrha , pa je tako potpredsednica vlade jadranka kosor u posebnom saopštenju , uz osudu tog vandalskog čina i ocenu da se radi o „ drskoj provokaciji uoči dana pobede , dana domovinske zahvalnosti i dana hrvatskih branitelja ” , zaključila i kako je ta „ poruka koja je osvanula na spomen domu neprihvatljiv govor mržnje ” . naravno , zna se čije i protiv koga . ipak , ispostavilo se da je reč o antisrpskoj provokaciji koja je trebalo da podstakne mržnju na ostatke tog naroda u hrvatskoj , pa tim pre treba čestitati policiji na brzom i efikasnom rešavanju ovog slučaja . počiniocu , kako je najavljeno , sledi prijava za krivično delo povrede ugleda rh . ili ... quote : opet hrvat u vukovaru pisao „ srpske grafite ” od našeg stalnog dopisnika zagreb– vukovarska policija uhapsila je juče jednog 42-godišnjeg muškarca hrvatske nacionalnosti pod sumnjom da je upravo on proteklih dana ispisao više „ prosrpskih grafita “ u ovom gradu i time počinio krivično delo povrede ugleda republike hrvatske . kako su hrvatski mediji sa zgražanjem javljali u vukovarskom naselju olajnica osvanuli su grafiti ispisani ćirilicom „ smrt hrvatima “ , „ smrt ustaši “ , „ živeo šešelj “ , „ živela srbija “ , „ ovo je srbija “ , „ kosovo je srbija “ , „ dobrodošli u republiku srpsku – svi ste vi srbi “ , „ vukovar je crno-beli grad “ , a sve to „ garnirano “ krstom s četiri ocila ( koje hrvatski mediji uporno nazivaju „ četiri ćirilična slova s “ i predstavljaju kao „ četnički grb “ ) . kako je izjavio glasnogovornik vukovarske policije krunoslav žgela , posle kriminalističke obrade uhapšeni autor grafita biće predat istražnom sudiji . zanimljivo je da je i pre pola godine u istom gradu utvrđeno da je takođe osoba hrvatske nacionalnosti ispisivala „ srpske grafite “ , tada na spomen-domu žrtvama streljanja na ovčari . bio je to darko radelić ( 44 ) iz zagreba , koji je baš uoči godišnjice vojne akcije „ oluja “ koja se slavi kao državni praznik „ dan domovinske zahvalnosti “ ispisao takođe ćirilicom uvredljive grafite očito da bi „ podgrejao “ netrpeljivost prema srbima . međutim , zahvaljujući akciji policije brzo je otkriven i zatim osuđen na osam meseci zatvora i psihijatrijsko lečenje . branio se pred sudskim većem da je bio ljut kada je čuo u vukovaru da „ neki govore srpskim jezikom “ . r. arsenić [ objavljeno : 05/02/2009 ] rahim ademi je bijelac kako se vidi iz priloženog ..... a i vrstan topdžija . pa da , vi i šiptari ste `` arijska '' braća ! e , a ne samo što fizički ličite , nego ste i mentalno ista djubrad : quote : planirana albanska podvala eograd - plan albanskih terorista da lažiraju upad vojske srbije na kosmet je sprečen , zahvaljujući dojavi operativaca naše vojske kforu . naime , pripadnici kfora su nedavno u okolini kosovske mitrovice zaplenili izvesnu količinu uniformi vojske jugoslavije . prema podacima kojima raspolažu vojni organi , jedna od paravojnih grupa nameravala je da inscenira navodni upad vs na kosovo i metohiju . takođe , postoje operativne informacije da isti planiraju i incidente oko bujanovca , preševa i uz granicu prema makedoniji . vojska srbije je najavila da neće tolerisati izazivanje sukoba na ovom području . zoran dragišić , ekspert za bezbednost , tvrdi da je scenario oblačenja uniformi protivnika odavno poznat . - te metode su odavno poznate u istoriji i meni ovo što rade albanci deluje veoma ozbiljno . njima bi ovakva akcija dala opravdanje da krenu u terorističke napade pod plaštom samoodbrane . inače , trik koji oni koriste je da za svaku akciju koriste drugo ime , učk , ana , učpbmne , a u principu se radi o istim ljudima , to jest o ovk . takvom metodom se stvara utisak da postoji više grupa , što podrazumeva veliku snagu . interesantno je da na isti način deluje al kaida . potpuno sam siguran da se opet radi , ponovo naglašavam , o jednoj jedinoj paravojnoj formaciji , a to je ovk - objašnjava dragišić . darko trifunović s fakulteta za bezbednost istog je mišljenja . - postoji zabluda kad su u pitanju raznorazne grupacije koje deluju , od ana pa do raznoraznih drugih . tu se radi o istim centrima moći . oni imaju multipraktik imena za svaku akciju koju izvode , iz razloga da te akcije ne bi bile povezane s bivšom ovk , što znači imaju dobre savetnike sa zapada . ali , poenta je u tome što to jeste i dalje ovk i isti ljudi . to treba raskrinkati , jer ovo nije prvi put da albanci insceniraju nešto . setite se ibra . njima bi upad vojske rs bio povod da traže nezavisnost - smatra trifunović . bratski narodi ... sve sami `` arijci '' vi klinci znate šta je to topdžija ?

      "sehr empfehlenswerter aktionsplan für nationalistische gruppen seaforth aktivismus in österreich - erste schritte zum freien widerstand vor ort -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- vorwort : dieser text richtet sich in erster linie an jene leute die zwar mit dem herzen schon lange bei uns und unserer sache sind aber unsere überzeugung und unsere ansichten noch nicht auf die straße getragen haben . vorweg , keine gruppe ist am anfang zu klein und es ist noch nicht einmal zu wenig wenn man gänzlich alleine anfängt ! viele der größten und bedeutendsten gruppen wurden von nur zwei oder drei menschen gegründet . vergiss darum nie , dass du ganz alleine in wenigen stunden hunderte flugblätter an hunderte von menschen verteilen kannst wobei viele bürger vielleicht zum ersten mal mit sachlichen argumenten unserer bewegung konfrontiert werden . ein netz von aktivisten , so klein dieses auch sein mag , das sich für gezielte aktionen und kampagnen zusammenschließt ist in vielen städten eine treibende kraft der bewegung und schon so manchem politischem gegner zum verhängnis geworden ! wenn auch du eine aktionsgruppe gründen möchtest , dann solltest du dir einmal sachlich überlegen wer von deinen freunden und bekannten da mitmachen würde , wer in frage kommt unsere sache positiv zu unterstützen und wer die kompetenz und den kampfgeist dazu hat unsere bewegung zu stärken . danach solltest du ein paar treffen organisieren , dort könnt ihr euch grundsätzliches überlegen . für den fall das ihr keine privaten räumlichkeiten besitzt , ein lokal das einen hinterraum anbietet findet sich in jedem kleinen dorf , durch ein gut organisiertes treffen ist der grundstein für eine entspannte atmosphäre gelegt ! normalerweise braucht es ein paar treffen , um sich auf eine linie und die grundlegenden schwerpunkte eurer gruppe zu einigen , vergesst dabei nie keine angriffsfläche zu bieten , es ist nämlich völlig sinnlos sich strahlende namen zu geben um den schein einer großen organisation zu imitieren oder sich eine symbolik und auftreten zuzulegen das nur der systempresse hilft aber den normalen jugendlichen oder bürger sofort abschreckt . macht euch auch klar wer euer gegner ist und heuchelt in eurem erscheinungsbild nichts vor das nicht der wahrheit entspricht , republikgeier und dumpfer austropatriotismus sind die aushängeschilder des systems welches wir ändern wollen , nicht die unseren . am anfang sollten die meisten gruppen noch nicht viel riskieren , verzichtet am anfang auch lieber auf medienwirksame aktionen oder eure gruppe wird schneller unter dem druck von polizei , staatssicherheitsbeamten und der öffentlichen ausgrenzung zugrunde gehen als sie entstanden ist , auch verwaltungsstrafen für ungenehmigte aktionen kosten geld und helfen euch und vor allem unserer sache nicht . viel wirkungsvoller sind für den anfang kleine legale und seriöse aktionen vor ort , je nach dem wie weit ihr gehen wollt müsst ihr euch aber auch darüber im klaren sein das ihr damit in das gespräch kommen werdet , sollte euch das in eurer heimatstadt unangenehm sein oder euch und eurer familie schaden dann tretet in einer nachbarstadt in aktion , solltet ihr keine fahrmöglichkeiten haben nutzt öffentliche verkehrssysteme für hin und rückfahrt . haltet euch vor augen . österreich ist bevölkert von kleinbürgerlichen menschen , es mag euch zwar vielleicht grandios vorkommen weltbewegende themen aufzugreifen , vergesst aber nie das die meisten bürger gerne einmal den kopf schütteln was irgendwo auf der welt oder europaweit passiert doch schon alleine durch die fehlende möglichkeit wirklich etwas dagegen zu tun die gedanken diesbezüglich schnell wieder abstreifen , versucht also inhaltlich die situation direkt vor ort aufzugreifen und diese mit themen höherer natur zu verbinden . so könnt ihr fehlenden weitblick überbrücken und die bürger dazu bringen sich ernsthaft mit eurer sache auseinanderzusetzen . der kampf um die köpfe ist knochenarbeit , flugblätter zu verteilen oder mit wildfremden leuten zu diskutieren ist manchen zu viel mühe , aber nichtsdestotrotz gibt es kaum eine einfachere art auf unsere sache aufmerksam zu machen und für unsere bewegung zu werben . für bis zu zwei personen , die nur zettel verteilen und plakate halten brauchst du keine anmeldung . zu zweit könnt ihr theoretisch spontan mit ein paar flugblättern eine miniatur-demo starten wo ihr wollt , sollte aber doch jemand die polizei verständigen folgt deren anweisungen , politische aktivisten sind in österreich vogelfrei , versucht daher gar nicht auf gesetzeslagen zu beharren , die folgen bei solchem verhalten enden immer bei empfindlichen geldstrafen die wesentlich besser in eure gruppe investiert werden könnten . macht euch klar wen ihr ansprechen werdet , denn niemand kann sich sein publikum aussuchen . mit flugblättern erreichst du im prinzip 3 gruppen von leuten : 1 ) leute , die es gar nicht interessiert und die auch kaum ihre lieb gewonnenen ansichten verwerfen werden . diese gruppe stellt den größten teil dar . diese leute erfahren aber zumindest , dass es eine bewegung wie die unsere gibt und dass sich menschen auch dafür einsetzen und aktiv daran mitarbeiten . obwohl diese gruppe alles andere als offen für unsere botschaft ist , werden unsere anliegen zumindest zu themen die mit der zeit immer alltäglicher für sie werden . so werden unsere bewegung und unsere inhalte immer mehr zum teil der politischen landschaft , es entstehen soziologische und politische analysen über eine wachsende bewegung . 2 ) menschen , die noch nie oder kaum vernünftiges zum thema volk , nation und den problemen dieser zeit gehört haben . diese leute sind offen für dieses thema und nehmen die informationen gerne auf oder hören zum ersten mal davon und beginnen sich kritisch damit auseinander zu setzen . die saat für eine spätere politische anteilname wurde gelegt . diese leute beginnen vielleicht sogar in folge diskussionen mit bekannten und verwandten um offene fragen zu klären , oder wollen sich weiter informieren . 3 ) die kleinste gruppe sind diejenigen , die sich schon mit unserer bewegung auseinander gesetzt haben und jetzt den anstoß bekommen ihre ansichten aktiv zu ändern . diesen leuten kannst du praktische ratschläge geben , letzte unklarheiten erhellen oder bedenken aus dem weg räumen . manches mal werden sich sogar leute melden , die bei euch mitarbeiten möchten , weißt niemanden ab , aber überfordert auch niemanden . flugblätter sind schnell hergestellt . zu diesem zweck kannst du entweder fertige flugblätter übernehmen und den namen eurer gruppe darunter setzen ( aber achtung , nicht alle gruppen sind einverstanden damit ) , oder du kannst von einigen flugblättern selbst das beste zusammenschreiben , so dass euer eigenes flugblatt entsteht . wie so oft ist es auch in diesem segment politischer arbeit sehr nützlich die technische möglichkeit zu haben um flugblätter billig kopieren oder drucken zu lassen . vergesst nie auf das flugblatt auch ein impressum zu schreiben , sonst setzt es beim ersten mal verwaltungsstrafen um die 100 euro und bei anderen druckwerken wie broschüren , zeitschriften oder gar büchern wesentlich härtere strafen . eine gültige adresse und euer gruppennamen reichen im prinzip , zusätzlich der name einer person von euch wäre aber fast besser . das impressum dient der polizei in erster linie dazu , eine stelle zu haben , an die sie sich wenden kann , wenn einmal etwas schief läuft , sich also irgend wer über eine spontane demo beschwert , oder klagen wegen unterlassung oder übler nachrede drohen , achtet daher immer darauf das der inhalt eurer flugblätter auch legal ist , vermeidet anspielungen und den wortgebrauch vergangener zeiten , stellt einen eindeutigen , faktischen und klaren inhalt zusammen der unanfechtbar ist und keine auslegung zu lässt welche euch schaden könnte ! wenn ihr drei bis vier leute zusammen habt , dann können zwei ein transparent halten , während die anderen flugblätter verteilen . viele leute , die keine flugblätter nehmen , lesen dann zumindest das transparent . da ein transparent auffälliger ist als einfach ein paar leute , die flugblätter verteilen solltest du auf dieses einfache mittel möglichst viele menschen mit deinem anliegen zu erreichen nicht verzichten . auch das rufen von slogans hat eine erstaunliche wirkung auf die passanten und vor allem auf jugendliche , menschen auf der anderen straßenseite welche euren protest vermutlich gar nicht bemerkt hätten , werden aufmerksam und lesen euer transparent oder kommen extra , um sich ein flugblatt zu holen , allerdings werden dadurch auch viele schüchterne menschen abgeschreckt , setzt dieses mittel also nur von zeit zu zeit ein und achtet darauf das eure lockmittel nicht in ruhestörung ausarten oder ihr seit gut und gerne 80 bis 100 euro an vater staat los und müsst eure aktion wohl oder übel abbrechen . die politischen gegner zeigen sich oft unangenehm berührt , da solche `` lautstarken '' proteste für diese ein schlag in die gutmenschliche fratze sind , manche personen werden auch versuchen euch kritisch in debatten zu verwickeln , blockt diese aber ab , diese monologe von unbelehrbaren personen sollen in den meisten fällen nur dazu dienen euch zu provozieren und andere menschen durch eine streitsituation vertreiben die sich interessiert zeigen würden . in den allerwenigsten fällen könnte es auch passieren dass ihr tätlich angegriffen werdet , wehrt euch dann in angemessener form , denn ihr habt alles recht eure meinung in eurem land kund zu tun und das darf euch niemand streitig machen . feigheit bestraft das leben , niemand muss sich für unsere bewegung schämen oder sich verstecken , insofern ihr euch korrekt verhalten habt könnt ihr auch die polizei einschalten um euch von solchen randalierern und chaoten zu befreien , schreibt euch daher immer die telefonnummer der polizei vor ort für den notfall heraus ! .\n",

      "teil 2 : wenn mehr als zwei leute an einer solchen demo teilnehmen , dann musst du diese demonstration auch vorher bei der zuständigen behörde anzeigen , dazu marschierst du einfach beim dortigen gemeindeamt , bezirkshauptmannschaft oder bürgermeisteramt ein und erklärst dich dort , je nach dem wird dir dort geholfen , gib dich dabei immer seriös und routiniert , welcher politischen bewegung du entstammst hat niemanden zu interessieren . du musst , wohlgemerkt die demo nicht wirklich anmelden wenn diese nur aus zwei oder drei leuten besteht , sondern nur die behörden über diese demo informieren , und zwar 24 stunden vor der demo ( nach dem versammlungsgesetz ) und oder 3 tage vorher ( nach der straßenverkehrsordnung ) schickst du ein fax oder einen brief an die zuständige behörde ( in wien die bundespolizeidirektion , abteilung vereins- und versammlungsbehörde ; sonst meistens die bezirkshauptmannschaft ) . man wird dir aber auf den ämtern schon auskunft geben welchen weg du gehen musst , lass dir so viel wie möglich schriftlich bestätigen um auch etwas in der hand zu haben . in dem fax oder brief zur anmeldung musst du schreiben : `` nach par . 2 versammlungsgesetz anzeige einer kundgebung '' . außerdem den zweck dieser demo ( z.b . `` demo gegen globalisierung '' ) , ort ( also die straße und hausnummer ; melde am besten immer auch ein paar mehr hausnummern auf beiden straßenseiten an , damit du auch auf der anderen seite flugblätter verteilen kannst , wenn genügend leute kommen ) , zeit ( von wann bis wann ) , verwendete mittel ( im prinzip darfst du alles verwenden , was du willst , musst es aber vorher angeben , z.b . flugblätter , transparente , infotisch , megaphon , ... ) erwartete teilnehmerzahl ( immer sicherheitshalber ein paar mehr angeben , da die polizei die demo auflösen darf , wenn mehr als angegeben demonstrieren ) und kundgebungsleiter ( mit name und anschrift ; ihr könnt aber auch schreiben `` wird vor ort genannt '' dann kommt normalerweise kurz nach beginn der demo ein beamter in zivil oder uniform und bittet eine person um name und anschrift . das dient im prinzip dem gleichen zweck wie das impressum ) . das fax oder der brief muss außerdem gut leserlich unterschrieben werden . am besten von jener person , die im fax als kundgebungsleiter genannt wird oder jene , die sich dann vor ort meldet ) . nimm eine kopie des fax oder briefs , und wenn vorhanden die faxbestätigung zur demo mit . du wirst übrigens von der behörde nur verständigt , wenn die demo nicht stattfinden darf . dann müssen sie dir eine untersagung schicken , die du im prinzip rechtlich anfechten kannst . aber die demo darf trotzdem nicht statt finden , in dem fall kannst du es grob gesehen vergessen , das kommt aber nur dann vor wenn man sich zu weit aus dem fenster lehnt , wenn man kurz und bündig schreibt das man als schüler oder jugendgruppe oder ähnliches eine demonstration mit fünf mann mit dem zweck von flugblattverteilung zum thema kapitalismus abhalten will wird niemand etwas dagegen einwenden . das hört sich zwar etwas kompliziert an , aber wenn du mit deinem konzept einfach auf eine behörde vor ort marschierst wird dir meistens sehr kompetent geholfen . wenn dich bei einer aktion irgendwelche leute auf unangenehme art nach der anmeldung fragen , dann kannst du sie getrost freundlich anlachen , denn diese haben nämlich als privatpersonen gar nichts zu melden , und können der polizei in folge damit ruhig auf die nerven gehen wenn sie damit drohen sollten , die darf dann antanzen um nach dem rechten zu sehen . trete der polizei gegenüber ruhig und bestimmt auf , werde nie ausfällig , aber verweise auch mit aller kraft auf deine verfassungsmäßig verbrieften rechte und zeige dich informiert über die rechtslage . die polizei braucht nicht mehr informationen über den hintergrund deiner gruppe als unbedingt notwendig , welche politische gesinnung du persönlich befürwortest ist deine private angelegenheit , fragen diesbezüglich musst du nicht beantworten . hausdurchsuchungen gibt es meistens wenn überhaupt bei der ganzen gruppe , das kann sein falls einmal illegale aktionen verübt wurden die mit euch in verbindung gebracht werden , dann werden die leute eurer gruppe nach der reihe belästigt die schon irgendwie aufgefallen sind oder zu euch gerechnet werden , achtet daher immer darauf im legalen bereich aktiv zu sein wenn ihr diese konsequenzen nicht tragen wollt . nach einem solchen besuch sofort die anderen aktivisten zu verständigen versteht sich von selbst . solltet ihr wie anzunehmend eine reine weste haben und trotzdem von staatsicherheitsbeamten belästigt werden verweist diese freundlich und zielstrebig aus eurem heim , bedenkt immer das ihr euch nicht im geringsten für eure persönlichen ansichten vor diesen herren rechtfertigen müsst , eine oft geforderte freiwillige durchsicht der eigenen räumlichkeiten kannst du getrost belächeln insofern du keinen wert darauf legst . waren diese beamten aus welchen gründen auch immer einmal bei euch steht ihr quasi auf der liste der verdächtigen , achtet dann immer darauf ob ihr beschattet werdet , die überwachenden bestehen dabei meist aus zwei herren im mittleren alter die euch zum beispiel an wochenenden verfolgen oder auch euer telefon abhören , bzw . gespräche mitschneiden und dann gegen euch solange ermitteln bis sie einmal zuschlagen können . dies ist natürlich der extremfall der kaum zu erwarten ist , und schon gar nicht wenn man immer im legalen bereich arbeitet , aber du solltest zumindest auch darüber informiert sein um für den fall der fälle immer gelassen darauf reagieren zu können . die allgemeine demonstrationskultur scheint in österreich besonders in der provinz ziemlich unterentwickelt zu sein , die provinzpolizei die von politischen gegnern manchmal sinnlos herbeigerufen wird scheint sich daher nicht wirklich auszukennen , die beamten sind oft völlig ratlos , versuchen wichtig dreinzuschauen und rufen im normalfall den vorgesetzten an um herauszufinden was zu tun ist , seit daher nett und versteht auch die beamten ein wenig wenn sie aus unwissen scheinbar falsch handeln , sie werden nun einmal so geschult immer so zu tun als würden sie recht haben und recht vertreten , auch wenn sie dabei völlig alleine im wald stehen . insofern eure gruppe gewachsen ist , und ein wenig geld vorhanden ist solltet ihr auch ein postfach eröffnen , das könnt ihr in jedem postamt einrichten und kostet euch kaum was . damit kann euch jeder bequem kontaktieren und von keinem gruppenmitglied wird die privatadresse allgemein bekannt . das postfach könnt ihr übrigens auch im impressum eurer druckwerke angeben . ihr solltet im lauf der zeit auch leute sammeln die sich vorstellen können an euren aktionen teilzunehmen , falls irgendwelche personen gegen euch ausfällig werden oder euch mit unlauteren mitteln bekämpfen , dann lasst euch das nicht gefallen sondern geht gezielt dagegen vor in dem ihr auf eure rechte pocht und auch mit verleumdungsklagen droht . nehmt im lauf der zeit auch kontakt zu anderen aktionsgruppen auf , im notfall könnt ihr euch dann gegenseitig für besondere aktionen organisieren . denn wenn bei einer demonstration oder aktion politische gegner ausfällig oder gar gewalttätig werden , dann sind diese leicht in die schranken zu weisen , wenn bei den nächsten aktionen gleich zwei oder dreimal so viele aktivisten antanzen ! am anfang könnt ihr ja immer zusammenlegen , wenn es um kosten geht . im lauf der zeit findet ihr vielleicht auch unterstützer , die euch regelmäßig eine kleine summe zukommen lassen wollen . zu diesem zweck könnt ihr in jeder bank ein anonymes sparbuch eröffnen , das auch als spendenkonto genutzt werden kann . wegen der auflagen , die von bank zu bank verschieden sind lass dich aber sehr genau von der bank beraten . die höchste form für kleingruppen im kampf auf der straße besteht darin ganze infotische zu machen , wo es flugblätter und schriften zum durchblättern und mitnehmen gibt . um an geld zu kommen ist es wohl am sinnvollsten im lauf der zeit einen stock von spendern aufzubauen , die euch regelmäßig unterstützen , auch wenn sie sonst nicht aktiv mitarbeiten möchten , dazu sollte man überlegen ob man der rechtslage wegen einen verein anmeldet . es ist sinnvoll kurz oder längerfristig erreichbare ziele anzupeilen , die etablierten politischen systeme stehen auch in kleinen orten schon auf sehr wackligen beinen , landesweit gibt es überall politikverdrossenheit aufgrund der unfähigkeit der amtierenden politiker . sobald ihr in einer stadt oder einem dorf etwas erfolgreich erwirkt habt werdet ihr sehen dass ihr auf dem richtigen weg wandelt . solche etappensiege geben kraft und auftrieb weiterzumachen , außerdem ist es oft leichter menschen für ein konkretes , erreichbares ziel zu gewinnen . vergesst auch nicht ein seriöses internetangebot zu organisieren wo ihr zumindest einige informationen und eine kontaktmöglichkeit angebt . stellt euch aber nicht unnötig im internet zur schau , das würde mehr politische gegner gegen euch aufbringen als es euch nutzt ! seid auch sparsam und vorsichtig wegen der inhalte eures internetangebots , findige juristen der gegenseite werden bestimmt ein auge auf eure texte haben . ich hoffe mit diesem kleinen leitfaden ein wenig geholfen zu haben . bei fragen und anregungen oder lust etwas sinnvolles im raum der steiermark zu unternehmen kann sich jeder gerne per pn melden , menschen die wirklich etwas bewegen wollen sind immer willkommen . anamcara - .\n",

      "die revolution in bayern 1918/19 von nikolaus brauns ( nach einer artikelserie in der tageszeitung junge welt von november 1998 bis juni 1999 ) '' bayern ist fortan ein freistaat ! '' `` freistaat bayern '' - das scheint heute ein synonym für csu-herrschaft , law-and-order-politik , rückständigkeit und intoleranz zu sein . kaum jemand denkt daran , daß es ein berliner sozialist war , der während der revolution 1918 bayern zum freistaat erklärte . stoiber und seine amigos verdrängen den revolutionären ursprung ihres geliebten `` freistaates '' und die bayerische spd - mitschuldige an der blutigen zerschlagung der bayerischen revolution - schweigt sich ebenfalls lieber aus . wie überall im reich herrschte auch in der bayerischen landeshauptstadt münchen ende 1918 lebensmittelknappheit , und kriegsverdruß . dazu kam noch die wut auf die berliner zentralgewalt . ging doch das gerücht um , vor allem bayerische soldaten würden als kanonenfutter für den preußischen kaiser geopfert . schon im januar 1918 war es in mehreren münchner rüstungsbetrieben zu streiks gekommen . der führer der münchner unabhängigen sozialdemokratie ( uspd ) , kurt eisner , war deswegen bis mitte oktober inhaftiert worden . kurt eisner , ein jüdischer literat aus berlin , der mit einer wilden weißen haarmähne und dichtem bart schon rein äußerlich nicht dem bild eines bayern entsprach , verstand es dennoch vorzüglich , gerade den preußenhaß der bayern für seine politischen ziele zu verwenden . in bayern , so eisner , seien die leute viel freiheitlicher gesinnt und kennen nicht die preußische überdisziplin . deswegen sei auch er als preuße nach münchen gekommen . vor dem krieg gehörte eisner zum revisionistischen flügel der spd um eduard bernstein . nicht der marxismus sondern die vernunftphilosophie emanuel kants war sein leitbild . als pazifist schloß sich eisner den in der uspd versammelten kriegsgegnern an . als die deutsche niederlage im krieg offensichtlich wurde und die reichsregierung vorsichtige demokratische reformen einleitete , um die verantwortung für die niederlage auf liberale und sozialdemokraten abzuwälzen , hielten die bayerischen arbeiter endgültig nicht mehr still . für den 7.november war auf der münchner theresienwiese eine friedenskundgebung einberufen worden . nicht nur eisners uspd , sondern auch die mehrheitssozialdemokraten ( mspd ) waren gezwungen , zur kundgebung zu mobilisieren , wollten sie nicht noch mehr anhänger an die unabhängigen verlieren . bis vor kurzem im burgfrieden mit könig und kaiser , widerstrebten den mspd-führern die demonstration zutiefst . untertänig versicherte deren vorsitzender erhard auer den königlich-bayerischen ministern , man werde kurt eisner `` schon an die wand drücken '' . 80.000 menschen strömten bei einem für die jahreszeit außergewöhnlich milden wetter auf die theresienwiese . nicht nur die mspd-nahen gewerkschafter der münchner großbetriebe , sondern auch radikalere sächsische arbeiter , die im krieg in den krupp-werken eingesetzt wurden , waren dabei . dazu kam eine große zahl von meuternden und desertierten soldaten . unter führung des blinden bauernbundführers ludwig gandorfer beteiligten sich bauern aus dem umland . gandorfer war ein sozialist aus dem freundeskreis von kurt eisner . auf seinem hof war auch `` helmi '' , der sohn von karl liebknecht untergekommen , der wegen der antikriegstätigkeit seines vaters nicht in berlin auf der schule bleiben konnte . neben den arbeitern , soldaten und bauern strömten noch die unvermeidlichen bierkeller-rabauken und schwabinger kaffeehausliteraten zur friedenskundgebung . einige dieser schwabinger intellektuellen sollten in den folgenden monaten noch führende positionen in der räterepublik erlangen . bis zu 25 redner sprachen gleichzeitig an verschiedenen stellen des weiten platzes . gemäßigte sozialdemokraten wie erhard auer versuchten , die aufgebrachte menge zu beruhigen und mit versprechungen baldiger reformen abzuspeisen . anarchisten wie der dichter erich mühsam propagierten die sofortige errichtung eines sozialistischen rätesystems nach sowjetischem vorbild . kurt eisner und die mehrheit der redner forderten den rücktritt des bayerischen königs und kaiser wilhelms ii. , die vereidigung des heeres auf die verfassung , eine demokratisierung des staates und die entfernung von reaktionären aus der verwaltung . die forderung nach annahme der alliierten waffenstillstandsbedingungen zur erlangung eines sofortigen friedens wird noch bis in bürgerliche kreise hinein mitgetragen . `` es lebe die revolution ! '' steht auf vielen plakate und rote fahnen dominieren die kundgebung . `` hoch eisner ! hoch die weltrevolution ! '' beantworten tausende von arbeitern , die sich unterhalb des bavaria-denkmals versammelt hatten , die rede des uspd-führers . ein teil der demonstranten unter führung erhard auers zog nach der kundgebung zum weit entfernten `` friedensengel '' . auf weisung von mspd-funktionären begaben sie sich sodann friedlich nach hause . auf der theresienwiese forderte unterdessen der noch in feldgrauer uniform gekleidete uspd-aktivist felix fechenbach : `` genossen ! unser führer kurt eisner hat gesprochen . es hat keinen zweck mehr , viele worte zu verlieren . wer für die revolution ist , uns nach ! mir nach ! marsch ! '' zehntausende von menschen setzen sich in bewegung , an der spitze arm in arm der hagere berliner literat eisner und der breitschultrige , bayerische bauer gandorfer . ziel der demonstranten war die nahegelegene guldeinschule , in der landstürmer untergebracht waren . nachdem der diensthabende major sich weigert , das gebäude zu übergeben , stürmen die revolutionäre das gebäude . die landsturmleute schließen sich augenblicklich den aufständischen an . waffen werden verteilt . auch bei den anderen münchner kasernen ergibt sich ein ähnliches bild . die wachen werfen ihre waffen weg , die mannschaften schließen sich mit roten wimpeln an ihren gewehren den revolutionären an . auch die gefangenen im `` franzl '' , dem militärgefängnis werden befreit . die wärter haben ihre uniformen gegen häflingskleidung vertauscht , um nicht erkannt zu werden . doch die erzürnten ex-häftlingen geben nicht auf , bis sie rache an ihren schindern nehmen können . bis 22 uhr sind alle münchner kasernen , die ministerien und der landtag , bahnhof , post und telegraphenamt in der hand revolutionärer arbeiter und soldaten . der bayerische könig ludwig iii . hatte an diesem tag seinen gewohnten spaziergang im englischen garten gemacht , als ihm ein schutzmann mitteilte , die revolution sei ausgebrochen . der könig nahm die angelegenheit zuerst nicht allzuernst . während sich eine menschenmenge vor der residenz versammelte , speiste er mit seiner gemahlin maria therese zu abend . erst auf druck einiger minister , die den ernst der lage erkannten , beschloß könig ludwig iii. , für einige tage die landeshauptstadt zu verlassen . wie weit die revolution schon vorgedrungen war zeigt , daß der könig den fahrer einer mietwagenfirma holen mußte , da der königliche chauffeur sich den aufständischen angeschlossen hatte . die revolutionäre begaben sich am abend in den größten münchner bierkeller , dem mathäserbräu in der nähe des hauptbahnhofs . um 22.30 uhr eröffnet eisner als erster vorsitzender die vorläufige konstituierende versammlung der arbeiter , -soldaten , - und bauernräte . begleitet von bewaffneten gardisten marschieren die ratsmitglieder zum landtagsgebäude , wo eisner die bayerische republik ausruft : `` die bayerische revolution hat gesiegt , sie hat den alten plunder der wittelsbacher könige hinweggefegt . der , der in diesem augenblick zu ihnen spricht , setzt ihr einverständnis voraus , daß er als provisorischer ministerpräsident fungiert . '' ausgehend von der revolution in münchen bildeten sich auch in anderen bayerischen städten wie passau , augburg , rosenheim , bayreuth und nürnberg arbeiter , - bauern , - und soldatenräte . ausgerechnet im konservativen bayern war der erste deutsche königsthron durch einen volksaufstand gestützt worden . am morgen des 8.novembers wehten rote fahnen auf den türmen der münchner frauenkirche und die presse verkündete die proklamation der republik durch ministerpräsident eisner : `` bayern ist fortan ein freistaat ! '' fanal der bayerischen revolution ich gehe jetzt , den eisner zu erschießen.rief anton graf arco einem verwandten zu , der ihm am morgen des 21 . februar zufällig begegnete . minuten später war der bayerische ministerpräsident kurt eisner tot . getroffen von zwei genickschüssen , die der junge offizier aus nächster nähe abgefeuert hatte . schwerverwundet durch die schüsse von eisners leibwächtern sinkt auch der attentäter vor dem bayerischen außenministerium im palais montgelas zu boden . nur eine sofortige operation durch den berühmten chirurgen professor sauerbruch kann ihm das leben retten . für eisner kam jede hilfe zu spät . nach karl liebknecht und rosa luxemburg hatten die deutschen arbeiter einen weiteren anführer durch den mordanschlag eines reichwehroffiziers verloren . am 7.november hatte der münchner uspd-vorsitzende kurt eisner die friedensdemonstration von 80.000 arbeitern , soldaten und bauern auf der theresienwiese angeführt . unter dem druck der kriegsmüden bevölkerung stürzte der bayerische königsthron . noch in der nacht zum 8.november verkündete kurt eisner als provisorischer ministerpräsident : bayern ist fortan ein freistaat. als preuße , jude , literat und sozialist war kurt eisner von anfang an dem besonderen haß aller reaktionären kräfte ausgesetzt . er sein ein ostjude , der eigentlich salomon koschinsky hieße und sich nur zur täuschung der bayern eisner nenne , lautete ein verbreitetes gerücht . im mittelpunkt der von der gesamten bürgerlichen presse getragenen diffamierungskampagne befand sich die satirisch-politische parteiose zeitung rote hand . herausgeber dieser antisemitischen hetzschrift war die thule-gesellschaft des mystikers rudolf von sebottendorff . ihren sitz hatte dieser orden für die deutsche art , der das hakenkreuz zu seinem symbol erwählte , im vornehmen hotel vier jahreszeiten . graf arco wurde eine mitgliedschaft in der thule-gesellschaft allerdings verwehrt , da er von der mutter her judenblut in den adern habe . die gesellschaft verstand sich als zentrale der gegenrevolution in bayern . unmittelbar nach der revolution am 10.november wurde der thule-kampfbund als bewaffneter kader gegründet . seine mitglieder arbeiteten verdeckt innerhalb der arbeiterparteien , der reichswehr und der polizei . auch in die von eisner gegründete republikanische schutztruppe wurden thule-agenten eingeschleust . ein erstes attentat des kampfbundes auf eisner anfang dezember mißlang allerdings . am 5.januar 1919 gründete der thule mann anton drexler als parteipolitischen arm der thule-gesellschaft , die deutsche arbeiterpartei , die später in nationalsozialistische deutsche arbeiterpartei umbenannt werden sollten . nicht nur von den völkischen fanatikern drohte eisner gefahr . auch sein koalitionspartner , die mehrheitssozialdemokratie mit innenminister erhard auer an der spitze ließ nichts unversucht , die alte ordnung wieder zu restaurieren . spd mitglieder sabotierten gezielt die arbeit der räte . den soldaten , - arbeiter- und bauernräten steht keinerlei vollzugsgewalt zu . sie haben daher jeden eingriff in die staatliche und gemeindliche verwaltungstätigkeit zu vermeiden , stellte auer bereits am 21 . november klar . als anhänger der philosophie emanuel kants sah eisner in den räten vor allen ein mittel zur erziehung der bevölkerung zur demokratie : die revolution ist nicht die demokratie , sie schafft erst die demokratie. daher wollte eisner den räten auch keine legislative oder exekutive gewalt übertragen , sondern ihnen lediglich beratende und kontrollierende funktionen gegenüber dem parlament zugestehen . die mitglieder des revolutionären arbeiterrates , vor allem anarchisten und anhänger der neugegründeten kpd , forderten dagegen ein rätesystem nach sowjetischen modell und wollten sich nicht mit der halben macht den räten zufriedengeben . als am 7.januar 1919 4000 arbeitslose versuchten , das sozial-ministerium am promenadenplatz zu besetzen , gab es drei tote und acht verwundete . eisner ordnet die verhaftung führender kpd-mitglieder und anhänger des revolutionären arbeiterrates an . unter den verhafteten sind auch der münchner kpd-chef max levien und der anarchist erich mühsam . eine demonstration vor das außenministerium kann die sofortige freilassung der verhafteten erzwingen . deutlich wurde die isolation des ministerpräsidenten in der landtagswahl vom 12 . januar . seine uspd blieb unter drei prozent . die wahlgewinner waren die konservative bayerische volkspartei mit 35 und die sozialdemokratie mit 33 prozent . zu diesem debakel für eisner trug auch der beschluß der kpd zum wahlboykott bei . in bayern stand die kpd noch stark unter dem einfluß der vereinigung revolutionärer internationalisten um den anarchisten erich mühsam , die sich zeitweilig der partei angeschlossen hatten . als drei tage nach der bayernwahl rechtsradikale freikorps in berlin karl liebknecht und rosa luxemburg ermordeten , rief der revolutionäre arbeiterrat zurrevolutionären wachsamkeit auf . auf der demonstration dominierten parolen wie alle macht den räten . an der spitze dieser demonstration fuhr im offenen auto der noch amtierende ministerpräsident des freistaates , kurt eisner . in seiner letzten öffentlichen rede forderte er , die massen zu sammeln , um das werk der revolution zu vollenden . die mordhetze gegen den ministerpräsidenten nahm von tag zu tag zu . alle , mit denen ich zusammentreffe , rechnen mit einem attentat auf eisner , vermerkt dr. herbert field , amerikanischer repräsentant der kommission für die friedensverhandlungen , in seinem tagebuch . man kann einem mordanschlag auf die dauer nicht ausweichen , und man kann mich ja nur einmal totschießen , antwortete eisner auf solche warnungen . als ihn am 21.februar die tödlichen schüssen trafen , befand er sich auf dem weg zum landtag , um seinen rücktritt als ministerpräsident verkünden . der schriftsteller oskar maria graf bereichtete : da hatten sich hunderte schweigend um die mit sägespänen bedeckten blutspuren eisners zu einem kreis gestaut . etliche soldaten traten in die mitte und erreichteten eine gewehrpyramide . dem einen rannen dicke tränen über die braunen backen . plötzlich fuhr vorne am promenadenplatz ein vollbesetztes lastauto mit dichten fahnen und maschinengewehren vorüber , und laut schrie es herunter : rache für eisner !  innenminister auer von der spd war in den augen vieler arbeiter der geistige urheber des mordes . der ruf wird laut : nieder mit dem verräter auer . dieser hatte gerade im landtag einen kurzen nachruf auf den ermordeten gehalten , als schüsse fielen . der metzger alois lindner , mitglied des revolutionären arbeiterrates , war mit einem browning gewehr in den plenarsaal gestürmt . auer bricht schwer verwundet zusammen , ein weiterer abgeordneter und ein offizier sind sofort tot . in wilder panik stürmen die landtagsabgeordneten aus dem gebäude . die macht liegt plötzlich beim neugebildeten zentralrat der arbeiter , . soldaten- und bauernräte bayerns . der zentralrat verhängt den ausnahmezustand über münchen . eisners bestattung am 26 . februar wird zu einer einzigen revolutionären kundgebung im ganzen land . als attentat auf die revolution wurde die bluttat denn auch vom proletariat bewertet , und es war nur natürlich , daß im augenblick nach seiner ermordung sich alle sympathien eisner wieder zuwandten . er war mit seinem tode zum symbol der bayerischen revolution geworden , erklärt erich mühsam die wirkung des attentats . der mord an kurt eisner sollte die zweite phase der bayerischen revolution einleiten , die in der errichtung der räterepublik gipfelte . anton graf arco wurde zum tode verurteilt , eine rechtsbürgerliche bayerische regierung wandelte das urteil schon anfang 1920 in festungshaft um . 1924 wird er begnadigt . er gilt bis heute als einzeltäter . spuren , die auf eine offiziersverschwörung und die thule-gesellschaft hindeuteten , wurden von der justiz ignoriert . an kurt eisner , den gründer freistaates bayern , erinnern bis heute nur zwei kleine tafeln an der stelle seiner ermordung gegenüber dem hotel bayerischer hof . die 1 . räterepublik in münchen als der sozialistische ministerpräsident kurt eisner am morgen des 21.februar 1919 von den schüssen des reichwehrleutnants anton graf arco tödlich getroffen zu boden fiel , war dies nicht wie von seiten des bürgertums erhofft das ende der bayerischen revolution . vielmehr ging die bewegung in ihre zweite , radikalere phase . von den schüssen des kommunistischen metzgers alois lindner wurde der gerade einberufenen landtag auseinandergetrieben . die macht lag plötzlich wieder bei den arbeiter , - soldaten- und bauernräten und deren obersten organ , dem zentralrat unter vorsitz des unabhängigen sozialdemokraten ernst niekisch . massendemonstrationen in ganz bayern zu eisners beerdingung zeugten von einem deutlichen linksruck in der arbeiterschaft durch die bluttat . die verfechter eines rätesstems waren wieder in der offensive . gerade auf dem bayerischen land entstanden unter der bisher passiven bevölkerung neue räte . in münchen tagte vom 25 . februar bis zum 8.märz ein rätekongreß , um über das weitere vorgehen zu beraten . wie sehr sich der unerfahrene münchner kpd-vorsitzende max levien täuschte , als er den rätekongreß schon als die diktatur des proletariats bezeichnete , zeigte sich , als am 27.februar die sozialdemokratisch geführte republikanische schutztruppe in den kongreß eindrangen und ihn und mühsam kurzerhand verhafteten . unter dem druck der räte mußten die revolutionäre zwar wieder freigelassen werden , doch die spd hatte deutlich gemacht , daß sie mit den räten so schnell wie möglich schluß machen wollte . vor allem scheiterte der rätekongreß an sich selber . ein arbeiter berichtet : proletarier ! ich bin seit 24 . februar in diesem hause und habe in keiner sitzung gefehlt . ich kann es kurz machen , ich habe den eindruck gewonnen , daß ich mich in einem narrenhause befinde und daß die insassen alle , wie sie hier sind , nicht fähig sind , auch nur ein atom für das volkswohl zu schaffen. die noch schwache kpd war auf dem kongreß kaum vertreten . zudem stand sie unter dem einfluß von mühsams anarchisten , die ihr kurzzeitig beigetreten waren . die zentristische uspd , die den größten teil der revolutionär gesinnten arbeiter repräsentierte , war in sich gespalten . ihr parteiführer karl kautsky weilte in münchen , um die partei auf einen gemäßigten kurs zu bringen . die führung der münchner uspd lag bei dem politisch unerfahrenen pazifistischen dichter ernst toller , der auch schon mal eine revolution der liebe ohne waffen forderte . nur die mehrheits-spd wußte genau , was sie wollte . während ihre vertreter auf dem rätekongreß mit der verschleppung vieler anträge zu fruchtlosen diskussionen beitrugen , richtete sich das 3.armeekommando in nürnberg unter führung des sozialdemokraten ernst schneppenhorst auf eine militärische niederschlagung der rätebewegung ein . der bayerische noske ließ flugblätter über münchen abwerfen , die mit offener gewalt drohten , sollten sich die räte nicht von anarchistischen und kommunistischen einfluß freimachen . ein antrag erich mühsams zur sofortigen ausrufung der räterepublik hatte der rätekongreß bereits mit 234 gegen 70 stimmen abgelehnt . stattdessen beschloß der kongreß die wiedereinberufung des landtages vorzubereiteten . die spd hatte unterdessen mit den bürgerlichen parteien , darunter der rechtsklerikalen bayerischen volkspartei , die bildung einer sozialdemokratischen minderheitsregierung vereinbart . die bürgerlichen parteien hatten erkannt , daß sie momentan über keinen rückhalt bei den massen verfügten und zur erdrosselung der revolution auf die spd angewiesen waren . in der ganzen naturgeschichte kenne ich kein eckelhafteres lebewesen als die sozialdemokratische partei bemerkte der anarchistische schriftsteller und räteaktivist gustav landauer damals . im sogenannten nürnberger kompromiß einigten sich uspd und spd auf die bildung einer regierung unter ministerpräsident hoffmann . militärminister wurde der bei den räten verhaßte schneppehorst . um die uspd zu besänftigen , wurden den räten beratende funktionen zugestanden . am tag der regierungsbildung am 18.märz erschien die erste ausgabe des kpd-organs münchner rote fahne . chefredakteur war eugen leviné , ein erfahrener kampfgefährte karl liebknechts und rosa luxemburgs . er war von der parteizentrale nach münchen geschickt worden , um der jungen bayerischen kpd unter die arme zu greifen . unter levinés leitung begann die partei systematisch mit dem aufbau von parteizellen in betrieben und kasernen . gewiß , wir stehen auf dem boden des rätesystems , aber wir haben die voraussetzungen erst noch zu schaffen , die dieses system gewährleisten . wir haben arbeiterräte zu bilden aus den betriebsräten der beschäftigten arbeiterschaft und der fülle der arbeitslosen umriß leviné die nächsten aufgaben der kommunisten . die erfahrungen der russischen revolution ebenso , wie das scheitern des berliner januaraufstandes , ließen leviné mißtrausch gegenüber putschismus und revolutionärer ungeduld sein . einige spd-führer hatten verstanden , daß es die einfachste art sei , den rätegedanken völlig zu kompromitieren , wenn sie selber aktiv zur verfrühten ausrufung einer räterepublik hindrängten . die stimmung unter großen teilen der arbeiterschaft war revolutionär . die ausrufung der räterepublik in ungarn am 20.märz war ein ermutigendes beispiel . am 4.april traten die augsburger arbeiter in den generalstreik und forderte die ausrufung der räterepublik . scheinbar unter dem eindruck der massenbewegung , in wirklichkeit aus konterrevoutionären kalkül wurden in münchen ausgerechnet der sozialdemokratische stadtkommandant dürr und militärminister schneppenhorst zu den entschiedensten vertretern der räterepublik . beide hatten in den wochen zuvor nicht gezögert , militärische gewalt gegen die räte anzudrohen . während anarchisten und unabhängige sozialdemokraten sich bedenkenlos mit den plötzlich gewendeten mehrheitssozialdemokraten gemein machten , verweigerte die kpd der geplanten räterepublik jegliche unterstützung . leviné warnte : das ganze scheint mehr eine provokation der spd zu sein . sie sehen , daß unser einfluß von tag zu tag größer wird , und versuchen nun , künstlich von oben eine räterepublik einzusetzen , die keinen genügenden unterbau hat und leicht zu zerschmettern und vor den massen zu diskreditieren ist . das gäbe ihnen auch den gewünschten anlaß , ihre truppen in münchen einmarschieren zu lassen. prophetisch erkannte er : nach dem ersten rausch würde folgendes eintreten : die mehrheitssozialisten würden sich unter dem ersten besten vorwand zurückziehen und das proletariat bewußt verraten . die uspd würde mitmachen , dann umfallen , anfangen zu schwanken , zu verhandeln und dadurch zum unbewußten verräter werden . und wir kommunisten würden mit dem blut unserer besten eure tat bezahlen. doch alle warnugen der kpd halfen nichts . in der nacht zum 7.april verkündete ernst niekisch im aufrag des revolutionären zentralrates : die entscheidung ist gefallen . baiern ist räterepublik. während sich in nürnberg , der zweitgrößte stadt bayern eine mehrheit gegen eine räterepublik ausgesprochen hatten , entstanden in anderen bayerischen städten kurzlebige räterepubliken , die schon nach ein bis zwei tagen zerfielen oder gestützt wurden . die größte änderung unter der vorgeblichen rätemacht schien allerdings die schreibweise baiers mit einem i statt einem y zu sein . die münchner rote fahne höhnte : alles wie sonst . in den betrieben schuften und fronen die proletarier nach wie vor zugunsten des kapitals . in den ämter sitzen nach wie vor die königlichen wittelsbacher beamten . an den straße die alten hüter der kapitalistischen wirtschaftsordnung mit dem schutzmannssäbel . kein bewaffneter arbeiter zu erblicke . keine roten fahnen . keine besetzung der machtpositionen der bourgeosie ...  tage der arbeitermacht trotz aller warnungen der kommunistischen partei hatten anarchisten , uspd und einzelne vertreter der spd am 7.april 1919 baiern zur räterepublik erklärt . der scheinräterepublik fehlte die stabile basis unter den arbeitern in den betrieben . auch verfügte sie über keine bewaffnete exekutive zur durchsetzung ihrer vollmundigen proklamationen . ein ganz eigenes schauspiel bot der rat der volksbeauftragten als oberstes organ . der volksbeauftragte für volksaufklärung gustav landauer hatte sich zwar einen namen als philosoph und shakespeare-übersetzer gemacht , war für die praktische politik allerdings gänzlich ungeeignet . die verbreitung atheistischer propaganda im streng katholischen bayern stand für ihn als überzeugten anarchisten im vordergrund . der volksbeauftragte für das äußere , ein gewisser dr. lipp , stellte sich nach wenigen tagen als geisteskrank heraus und mußte in die psychatrie eingeliefert werden . zuvor ließ er noch absurde erklärungen per funk verbreiten . in einer lageschilderung an lenin beklagte er so : bamberg sitz des flüchtlings hoffmann , welcher aus meinem ministerium den abortschlüssel mitgenommen hat. für die finanzen verantwortlich war der erfinder der freigeldlehre silvio gesell , dessen wirre theorien von der abschaffung des kapitalistischen geldes als dritter weg zwischen kapitalismus und kommunismus bis heute von anarchisten und neofaschisten gleichermaßen nachgebetet werden . der sozialdemokrat schneppenhorst , der zuvor die räterepublik mit ausgerufen hatte , setzte sich nach nürnberg ab , um als militärminister der regierung hoffmann die militärische niederschlagung der scheinräterepublik vorzubereiten . nach nur sechs tagen war das gastspiel der schwabinger kaffeehausliteraten in der politik beendet . wie die kpd gewarnt hatte , nutzte die nach bamberg geflohene sozialdemokratische regierung hoffmann das chaos der scheinräterepublik für einen gegenrevolutionären putsch . am palmsonntag den 13.april besetzten mitglieder der republikanischen schutztruppe öffentliche gebäude in münchen und verhafteten 12 mitglieder der räteregierung . die kommunisten , die sich bisher auf das schärfste von der scheinräterepublik distanziert hatten , sahen jetzt die notwendigkeit , sich an die spitze des kampfes gegen die putschisten zu stellen . gestützt auf die in den letzten wochen geschaffenen betriebs- und kasernenräte organisierte die kpd die bewaffnete niederschlagung des palmsonntagsputsches . die kpd hatte die verantwortung übernommen und konnte nicht mehr zurück . ein aktionsausschuß der drei arbeiterparteien wählte einen vollzugsrat mit dem kommunisten eugen leviné an der spitze . die kommunistisch geführte räteregierung ergriff sogleich maßnahmen zur verteidigung der revolution . ein 10-tägiger generalstreik gab ihr zeit , die arbeiter zu bewaffnen . an der spitze der bayerischen roten armee stand der 22-jährige matrose rudolf egelhofer , der zudem stadtkommandant von münchen wurde . zur entwaffnung des bürgertums erließ er folgenden aufruf : beschluß ! sämtliche bürger haben binnen 12 stunden jede art von waffen in der stadtkommandantur abzuliefern . wer innerhalb dieser zeit die waffe nicht abgegeben hat , wird erschossen. um die versorgung der bevölkerung sicherzustellen , beschlagnahmte die rote armee lebensmittellager und hamsterware . in den betrieben übten die betriebsräte die kontrolle über die finanzen aus und erhöhten die löhne . die bürgerliche presse wurde verboten oder erschien unter kontrolle der räte . es herrschte tatsächlich die diktatur des proletariats in münchen . die regierung hoffmann hetzte die landbevölkerung gegen die diktatur der russen und juden in der stadt auf , die angeblich die frauen zu gemeineigentum erklärt hätten . eine hungerblockade gegen die münchner räterepublik setzte ein . jetzt rächte es sich , daß die münchner revolutionäre die bauernfrage im agrarland bayern unterschätzt hatten . da es nicht gelang , ausreichende bayerische truppen auszuheben , die bereit waren , gegen ihre landsleute in münchen zu kämpfen , entschloß sich ministerpräsident hoffmann , von gustav noske freikorps aus berlin anzufordern . in der zweiten aprilhälfte rückte 35.000 soldaten der weißen armee unter general v. oven auf münchen zu . mit dabei waren protofaschisten wie der ritter von epp und der spätere führer der fememörder-organisation orgesch escherich . viele soldaten trugen schon das hakenkreuz am helm . bayerische offiziere bekamen keine befehlsgewalt . ein überraschender sieg der roten armee unter führung tollers am 16.april in dachau verleitete die uspd dazu , verhandlungen mit der bamberger regierung zu suchen . doch hoffmann hatte die macht längst armee und freikorps überlassen und besaß keinerlei handlungsspielraum mehr . während die kleinbürgerlichen kräfte um toller der konterrevolution soweit entgegenkamen , daß sie die bürgerliche presse wieder zuließen , fanden die kommunisten mit ihrer forderung nach verteidigung der arbeitermacht bis zum letzten mann keine mehrheit und mußten am 27.april aus dem aktionsausschuß ausscheiden . am 1.april 1919 drangen die weißen truppen in münchen ein . bis heute beklagt jedes bayerische schulbuch den roten terror der erschießung von 10 geiseln im luitpoldgymnasium durch rotgardisten . alle geiseln waren mitglieder bewaffneter rechtsextremer verbände wie der thulegesellschaft . vergessen sind dagegen die massaker der weißen an über 1000 münchner arbeitern . in den arbeitervierteln giesing , sendling und um den schlachthof wüteten die freikorps besonders grausam . bürgerliche münchner , die sich die letzten tage im keller verkrochen hatten , bildeten einwohnerwehren zur jagd auf revolutionäre arbeiter . aufgrund willkürlicher denunziationen wurden hunderte münchner verhaftet oder gleich erschossen . als denunziant tat sich auch der gefreite des 2.infantrieregiments adolf hitler hervor . während der revolution hatte er sich ängstlich im hintergrund gehalten . nun lieferte hitler diejenigen regimentskameraden ans messer , die die räterepublik unterstützt hatten . willkürlich wurden 21 katholische gesellen niedergemetzelt , weil sie für spartakisten gehalten wurden und 55 russische kriegsgefangene exekutiert . kommandant egelhofer wurde am 2.mai erschossen , gustav landauer im gefängnis stadelheim erschlagen . an der mauer des gefängnisses prangte der spruch : hier wird aus spartakistenblut blut- und leberwurst gemacht. eugen leviné wurde nach einem fragwürdigen prozeß zum tode verurteilt und hingerichtet , erich mühsam kam in langjährige festungshaft . tote auf urlaub wir kommunisten sind alle tote auf urlaub , dessen bin ich mir bewußt . ich weiß nicht , ob sie mir meinen urlaubsschein noch verlängern werden , oder ob ich einrücken muß zu karl liebknecht und rosa luxemburg , erklärte eugen leviné in seiner verteidigungsrede vor dem münchner standgericht anfang juni 1919 . vor einem knappen monat hatten die noske-garden das rote münchen eingenommen . über 1500 arbeiter wurden niedergeschlachtet , viele revolutionäre wie der anarchist gustav landauer und der rote matrose rudi egelhofer fielen schon in den ersten stunden der lynchjustiz zu opfer . mit besonderem eifer suchten die bürgerwehren aber eugen leviné , einen jungen mann , von jäher und wilder energie , der in den augen des publizisten sebastian haffner möglicherweise das zeug zu einem deutschen lenin oder trotzki hatte . der sohn einer jüdischen kaufmannfamilie war 1883 im russischen petersburg zur welt gekommen . in heidelberg , wohin in die mutter zum studium geschickt hatte , kommt er in kontakt mit revolutionären ideen durch russische emigrantekreise . er schließt sich 1903 der sozialrevolutionären partei an , die einen bäuerlichen sozialismus anstrebte und nimmt an der russischen revolution von 1905 teil . 1907 wird er verhaftet und schwer mißhandelt . die mutter , mir der er zuvor wegen seiner politischen ideale gebrochen hat , kauft ihn mit einer hohen kaution frei . zurück in deutschland nimmt er die deutsche staatsbürgerschaft an . im weltkrieg gehört er zu den mitbegründern der spartakusgruppe . als in rußland die oktoberrevolution siegt , stellt sich leviné der russischen botschaft zur verfügung , wo er für rosta , die vorgängerin der nachrichtenagentur tass arbeitet . für die spartakusgruppe tritt er als agitator im ruhrgebiet auf . die ruhrarbeiter verleihen ihm als einzigen wichtigen kpd-führer ein mandat für den allgemeinen kongreß der arbeiter und soldatenräte deutschlands . mitte märz wird leviné von der kpd-zentrale nach münchen geschickt , um dort die münchner rote fahne heraus zu geben und die aktivistische aber unerfahrene ortsgruppe der münchner kpd anzuleiten . unter levinés anleitung wird ein betriebrätesystem geschaffen , auf das sich die kommunisten in der räterepublik stützen können . seit der russischen erfahrung ist der rätegedanke zentral in levinés denken . ich hätte niemals an einer revolution teilgenommen , welche von den führern geschoben worden wäre. in der kommunistische räterepublik steht leviné an der spitze des vollzugsausschusses . als jude und russe zieht er sich den besonderen haß der rechten zu . selbst der dichter ernst toller , führer der uspd in münchen , schreckt zuletzt nicht vor antisemitischen angriffen auf leviné zurück . ein hagerer mann , aus dessen eingefallenem gesicht die gebogene fleischige nase groß hervorspringt. beschreibt ihn toller auch später im jahr 1933 in bester stürmer-manier . knapp zwei wochen nach dem ende der räterepublik , am 13.mai , wird leviné gefaßt . gegen ein kopfgeld von 10.000 mark hat ihn ein spitzel der polizei ausgeliefert . bei dem anschließenden hochverratsprozeß geht es nicht um recht , sondern nur noch um macht . das gericht in der münchner au gleicht einem heerlager . maschinengewehre und handgranaten allerorts . auch die erschießung von geiseln , die der rechtsextremen thulegesellschaft angehörten , wirft ihm das gericht vor . obwohl leviné mit der geiselerschießung nichts zu tun hatte , lehnt er es ab , diese zu verurteilen . seine frau rosa meyer-leviné schildert seine motive : vielleicht hätte er sein leben retten können . das wäre dann aber nicht mehr das leben eines revolutionären führers gewesen und hätte seiner sache nicht mehr gedient . es gibt kein schachern , wenn es um menschliche integrität geht . ein kompromißlerischer , kriecherischer leviné hätte in einem langen leben nicht mehr das erreicht , was er in seinen letzten tagen erreicht hat . aus dem einfachen grund , weil er dann moralisch tot gewesen wäre. fällen sie das urteil , wenn sie es für richtig halten . ich habe mich nur dagegen gewehrt , daß meine politische agitation , der name der räterepublik , mit der ich mich verknüpft fühle , daß der gute name der münchner arbeiter beschmutzt wird . diese und ich mit ihnen zusammen , wir haben alles versucht , nach bestem wissen und gewissen unsere pflicht zu tun gegen die internationale und die kommunistischen weltrevolution. schloß leviné seine verteidigungsrede . das standgericht verurteilt ihn zum tode . am 5.juni 1919 wird er von einem exekutionskommando erschossen . es lebe die weltrevolution , lauten seine letzten worte . mit einem 24-stündigen generalstreik im ganzen land protestieren arbeiter gegen diesen akt der klassenjustiz . heute ist eugen leviné weitgehend vergessen . in münchen erinnert kein straßenname und keine gedenktafel an den mann , der damals in einem atemzug mit karl liebknecht und rosa luxemburg genannt wurde . der spd , die zur niederschlagung der revolution bereit war , die verhaßte preußischen truppen nach bayern zu holen , haftete seitdem der ruf des landesverräters an . es ist den bayerischen sozialdemokraten bis heute nicht gelungen , sich von ihrer damaligen schmach zu erholen . für das münchner bürgertum waren die wenigen tage der arbeitermacht ein so gewaltiger schock , daß das pendel im einstmals liberalen münchen völlig umschlug . jede kleinste regung von linker seite sollte von nun an im keime erstickt werden . unter breiter zustimmung der nicht-proletarischen bevölkerungsschichten gingen die rechtsextremen wehrverbände und die bvp daran , die ordnungszelle bayern als zentrum der gegenrevolution auszubauen , die heute in der csu-herrschaft ihre fortsetzung findet . die münchner kommunistische episode ist vorüber . eines gefühls der befreiung und erheiterung entschlage auch ich mich nicht . der druck war abscheulich , schrieb der schriftsteller thomas mann nach dem sieg der gegenrevolution in sein tagebuch . so wie er fühlten damals viele vertreter des bürgertums . nur die wenigsten konnten sich zu der späteren erkenntnis thomas manns durchringen , daß der antikommunismus die grundtorheit des jahrhunderts ist .

      "r.i.p. ! 18 . mai 2006 war junger arischer patriot dmitrij borovikov beim verhaftungsversuch von zog-hunden ermordet . er war ermordet mit dem niederträchtigen hinterkopfschuss . russland hat ein von seine beste söhne verloren und wir alle unsere freund und mitkämpfer . der verlust von kamerad ist immer schmerzlich . das ist schmerzliche aber immer unsere bewegung begleitende unvermeidlichkeit . unvermeidlichkeit , weil der weg des kampfes für das volk ist schwierig und gefährlich . dima borovikov . treuer freund , kamerad und mitkämpfer ; liebender sohn und einfach hervorragender mensch . dima war ein unerschütterlicher nationalsozialist . er war bis zum tod sich selbst , seinen kameraden und ns-ideen treu . dima ist als nationalsozialist gestorben . er isst gestorben ein paar wochen vor seinem 22 . geburtstag . dima wurde ein skinhead mit 16 und von dieser zeit war er in weiße widerstandsbewegung sehr aktiv . in strassenschlägerei bewährte er sich als angstloser kämpfer , er soff und rauchte nicht und gebrauchte nicht drogen . erst mal wurde sein name weit bekannt wann gegen die shultz88crew-leute ermittelt wurden . damals wurde er als die rechte hand von dima bobrov , der crew-stifter genannt . anklage hauptexperte girenko , der die anwesenheit von rassistischen materiale in die ausgaben von der crew beweisen musste , wurde von einer unbekannten person durch einen schuss durch seine wohnungstür vernichtet . denn es war die mad crowd crew sache . damals wurde alle teilnehmer von die gruppe außer dima und ruslan , der führer , verhaften . sie wäre wegen stiftung der extremistische gruppierung angeklagten . die leute haben ein paar dutzende imigrantische parasiten und andere feinde und verräter verprügelt . die ermittlung schaffte nur ein paar episoden beweisen weil meiste von der geschädigten damals in ihre länder wäre und haben ins gericht nicht gekommen von der abrechnung erschreckt . man muss sagen dass die mad crowd-leute hatten sich als wahre nationalsozialisten bewährt . sie wurde auf die folter gespannt doch niemand hatte jemandem verraten . unter dimas mitwirkung ausgaben die mitkämpfer aus mad crowd die literatur in der mitteilten sei sein erfahrung mit die jugend und propagierten die gesundheitsverhalten . seit april 2005 war dima in internationale fahndung wegen extremismus . das machte ihn aber nicht stutzig . er fortsetzte ins weiße leben von der stadt teilnehmen . es ist bekannt das er in diese zeit hat mit seine mitkämpfer eine ganze reihe von aktionen gegen antinationale behörden organisiert . unter anderem eine serie von revolutionären enteignungen . als man versuchte dima zu verhaften in eine gasse , er war nicht überrascht , hat ein von die bullen angegriffen und verschwand . 27 . april wurde ein aktive antifa- * * * * * * , ein von afrikanische einheitsführern durch den pompengewehrschuss in sankt petersburg vernichtet . manche verhältnisse zeigten , dass dima daran beteiligt war für ortsbehörde wurde dmitrij borovikov ein wahrer dorn im auge der stadt ihrer stadt die beste repressive kräfte von sankt petersburg und moskau wurde geschickt um ihn zu suchen . im laufe der zwei monate , april und mai , verhörte die miliz viele ns gebundene leute . sie wäre peinlich verhört um irgendwas über dima auszuforschen . endlich am 18 . mai haben sie seine aufenthaltsort gefunden . das war ein ergebnis der verhör von einen der zahlreiche informatoren in ns-bewegung . die einsatzgruppe kam zu den haus an in dem er wohnte . der hinterhalt war so organisiert , das dima keine rückzugswege hatte . sie planten ihn lebendig zu verhaften als dima aus dem haustur ausging hat er alles verstanden und rannte los . ein von der milizionäre schnitte ihn den weg ab . ein schlagerei fing an . dima versuchte ihn mit ein messer zu schlagen doch er weichte aus . und ein andere schiss dima tot . es war kein obligatorischer luftschuss , man schiss ein unbewaffnete mensch in dem kopf . die ärzte versuchte ihn nicht zu retten . dima borovikov lebte ein hervorragendes ns-revolutionärsleben . ein von tausenden russischen helden die jeden tag ihre leben riskieren für die wiedergeburt russlands . und wir wissen jeder tag es wird mehr solche leute . er kämpfte als nationalsozialist . er starb als nationalsozialist . er starb aber er war nicht besiegt . stirb in kampf . schnell , leicht und schön die mitkämpfer der russische nationale befreiungsbewegung betrachten diesen mord als eine vorbildliche einschüchterungsaktion die soll die allmacht und übergebung der geltenden gesetze der systems repressivorgansansestellte . es ist offensichtlich dass in russland gelten für die anhänger der nationale ideologie keine gesetze und verfassungsmäßige rechte . ungesetzliche verfolgungen , verbote , verhaftungen und gefängnishaften für die aktivisten der nationalen opposition sind heute die alltägliche realität aber die abrechnung mit dmitrij ist der erste fall der körperliche vernichtung der träger der unerwünschte ideen , der gnadenlose und vorbildliche vernichtung . die fortsetzung der vernichtungskampagne der mitkämpfer der nationalen opposition ist nicht abgeschossen , aber trotzdem wird die rechte bewegung nicht untergebunden ! dima , wir trauern um dich . wisse , das niemand von deine verfolger wird vergessen und bleibt straflos . und du bleibst immer in unsere herzen . schlaff ruhig , unsere horst wessel . wir wissen , dass du irgendwo in der nähe bist , irgendwo in unsere reihen . ruh in frieden , bruder . der kampf geht weiter !\n",

      "die etablierten blockparteien , die sich den staat zur beute gemacht haben und die parlamente bisher als ihr ausschließliches eigentum betrachteten , sind nicht mehr allein . mit einem donnerschlag endete der wahltag in sachsen , wo der systemoppositionellen npd mit 9,4 prozent der einzug in den dresdner landtag gelang . die npd stellt damit im 40ten jahr ihres bestehens 13 abgeordnete und liegt damit mit der spd gleichauf , von der sie gemessen an ihrem stimmenanteil ( 9,8 prozent ) nur noch prozentbruchteile entfernt ist . dies kommt durchaus einem historischen durchbruch gleich . vor allem die arbeiter mit 13 prozent und die arbeitslosen mit 18 prozent machten damit die npd zur eigentlichen gewinnerin . desgleichen verliert die cdu nicht nur 15 prozent der stimmen , sondern auch mit 41,2 prozent die absolute mehrheit . die pds legt leicht zu und kommt auf 23,5 prozent . die fdp erreicht 5,8 prozent , und die grünen liegen bei etwa 5 prozent und könnten erfreulicherweise noch außen vor bleiben in brandenburg zieht die dvu nach leichten stimmengewinnen mit 6,2 prozent wieder in den landtag ein . zusammen mit den wahlverweigerern gibt es damit erstmals eine mehrheit gegen das system der etablierten übeltäter ! diese stehen ab sofort unter verschärfter beobachtung einer starken fundamentalopposition , was zweifellos zur folge hat , daß man nun gezwungen sein wird , sich wieder etwas mehr mit dem eigenen volk auseinanderzusetzen . dabei ist es schon ein erfolg an sich , daß die idylle einer abgehobenen politikerkaste , die jeden kontakt zur normalen bevölkerung längst verloren hat , massiv gestört ist . unter der ständigen drohung weiterer nationaler wahlerfolge bei nichtbeachtung des volkes , wird man sehen , was weiter geschieht . es scheint sicher , daß der nationalistischen npd heute das zweitbeste ergebnis ihrer 40jährigen geschichte vor allem deshalb gelang , nicht obwohl sie als systemfeindlich gilt , sondern weil sie das system überwinden will . tatsächlich ist die npd nicht eine partei neben den anderen , sondern sie ist eine partei gegen sie . wie es sich bei der landtagswahl in sachsen zeigte , haben viele wähler genau auf eine solche wirkliche oppositionspartei gewartet , denn man hat mittlerweile vielerorts begriffen , daß die etablierten nicht nur kein problem wirklich lösen können , sondern in der regel durch unfähigkeit und böswilligen ideologischen vorsatz den schaden noch vergrößern . es zeigt sich mithin : die etablierten übeltäter sind selbst die ursache aller probleme , da sie mit dem eigenen volk schon längst nichts mehr zu tun haben und ganz offenkundig nur noch klientelpolitik für reiche , ausländer und andere randgruppen betreiben . in mitteldeutschland , wo probleme wie die strukturelle massenarbeitslosigkeit und der wirtschaftliche niedergang als folge der von den etablierten gewollten globalisierung noch viel größer als anderswo in der brd sind , ist die enttäuschung über das system so groß , daß der wähler zunehmend bereit ist , auch eine opposition zu wählen , die sich aus eigenem willen ganz bewußt außerhalb des systems positioniert . das ist auch der grund , warum es der pds in sachsen nicht wirklich gelang , den protest systemkonform zu kanalisieren , denn man hat durchaus nicht vergessen , daß die pds in zwei mitteldeutschen landesregierungen sitzt und dort brav mitspielt . der geächteten npd glaubt man hingegen , daß sie dem system feind ist  und wählt sie mithin aus diesem grund . die parlamentarisch vertretene nationale und soziale fundamentalopposition hat nun die aufgabe , sand ins getriebe des korrupten und maroden systems zu streuen . daneben gilt es , das politische bewußtsein dahingehend zu schärfen , daß man durchaus etwas tun kann gegen die vermeintliche allmacht der volksverderber . aus diesem grunde darf es im parlament so etwas wie eine konstruktive mitarbeit überhaupt nicht geben . denn erstens wurde man dafür nicht gewählt , sondern dafür daß endlich mal jemand den etablierten feuer unterm hintern macht . und zweitens würde konstruktive mitarbeit von den gleichgeschalteten systemmedien ohnehin verschwiegen , um hinterher entlarvend behaupten zu können , die bösen rechtsextremisten hätten nichts bewirken können . aber wie sollten sie das auch ? die politik wird von der regierung gemacht - und da auch nicht wesentlich von einer landesregierung , sondern natürlich von der bundesregierung in berlin . man kann es sich also schenken , mit parlamentarischen eingaben eindruck schinden zu wollen , die ohnehin von der blockpartei cduspdgrünepdsfdp geschlossen niedergestimmt werden , wenn sie von der npd kommen . da es überdies auf die meinung der etablierten übeltäter und das ansehen , das man bei ihnen genießt , gar nicht ankommt , ist es sinnvoller , alle kraft darauf zu verwenden , eine in der öffentlichkeit wahrnehmbare fundamentalopposition zu sein , die völlig ungeniert gegen sozialabbau und verausländerung agitiert . tatsächlich muß jeder erfolg bei kommunal- und landtagswahlen dem einen großen ziel dienen , die herrschaft des volksfeindlichen regimes zu beenden , um eines tages auf demokratischem wege regierungsgewalt für die interessen des deutschen volkes ausüben zu können . mit dem heutigen tage ist man diesem ziel ein ganzes stück näher gekommen . © waldemar maier , 19.9.2004 alle rechte vorbehalten vervielfältigung nur mit genehmigung des autors\n",

[ .... ] so ganz allmählich bekommt das system kalte füße . die stimmung im land nähert sich teilweise einem vorrevolutionärem siedepunkt . wie 1989 in der ddr , kehrt der ruf zurück : wir sind das volk !  es ist nicht nur die empörung über soziale zumutungen , wie hartz iv , die die roten , schwarzen , grünen , gelben , inklusive pds gemeinschaftlich ausbaldowern . die systemparteien erfreuen sich des ansehens einer räuberbande , deren gezänk allein der beuteverteilung dient , bereit für einen ministerlohn jede schweinerei zu begehen . es spricht sich herum , daß die etablierten parteien das problem nicht lösen können , weil sie selber das problem sind . sie sind verantwortlich für massenarbeitslosigkeit und ruin der sozialsysteme , sie haben die grenzen geöffnet für asylbetrüger und wohlfahrtssuchende aus aller welt . die deutschen zahlen steuern und abgaben in einer höhe , die nicht einmal im letzten krieg erreicht wurde . wo bleibt das geld ? es wird aus dem fenster geworfen , in die kassen von eu und nato , für kriegseinsätze und wiedergutmachung , für projekte , die überhaupt nichts mit den interessen unseres volkes zu tun haben . es ist nur noch eine frage der zeit , bis gegenentwürfe zum tragen kommen . das regime rettet sich von einer wahl zur nächsten , aber nur weil das volk bislang ohne murren diese veranstaltung finanziert hat . wie schnell sich das ändern kann , weiß man spätestens seit 1989 . höchste zeit auf die straße zu gehen und widerstand zu leisten ! die politische hoffnungslosigkeit , die sich bei vielen in den letzten jahren lähmend verbreitete , muß einer kämpferischen entschlossenheit weichen . in der wirtschaftlich und moralisch bankrotten brd wird sich so oder so der soziale protest , der schon sehr bald ein nationaler widerstand sein wird , seine bahn brechen ! in der npd herrscht eine aufbruchstimmung wie seit jahren nicht mehr ! fast in allen bundesländern konnte die npd zur europawahl ihr ergebnis deutlich verbessern . bei den kommunalwahlen erreichten wir bundesweit über 70 mandate . bei der landtagswahl im saarland am 5 . september erreichte die npd über 4 % . unser referent peter marx hatte hierbei als npd-landesvorsitzender des saarlandes entscheidenden anteil und wird interessante dinge zu berichten wissen . besonders hoffnungsvoll stimmt uns die landtagswahl in sachsen am 19 . september . mit der dvu konnte eine wahlabsprache getroffen werden und die rep sind an der unterschriftenhürde gescheitert . die npd führt dort einen vielversprechenden wahlkampf und hat die historische chance , daß endlich im sächsischen landtag deutsche politik gemacht wird ! auch die rekord-teilnehmerzahl von fast 7000 menschen beim pressefest der deutschen stimme , die öffentliche beteiligung der npd vielerorts an den montagsdemonstrationen , oder der diesjährige machtvolle rudolf-hess-marsch mit ebenfalls rd . 7000 teilnehmern , zeigen deutlich , daß sich endlich etwas tut ! die große aufgabe des nationalen widerstandes besteht heute darin , die sich allmählich formierende volksbewegung mit allen kräften zu unterstützen und diese in nationalistische gesinnungsbahnen zu lenken . dann stürzt nicht nur die spd-regierung , sondern das ganze brd-system ! daran glauben wir und dafür kämpfen wir ! die npd kommt ! geben sie uns weiterhin ihre unterstützung und ihre treue in dieser wichtigen zeit ! über ein wiedersehen bei unserer veranstaltung würden wir uns sehr freuen und verbleiben , mit herzlichem gruß , nationaldemokratische partei [ name entfernt ] -kreisvorsitzender- =========================================\n",

      "der_professor , von der linksradikalen seite geht eigentlich auch keine wirkliche gefahr aus , wenn man das mal genauer ansieht . ein haufen hirnloser vollidioten , welche sich fuer das groesste halten , und nicht mal diskutieren , geschweige denn argumentieren koennen , kann und muss man nicht wirklich ernstnehmen . jedoch leute , welche etwas im koepfchen haben , welche argumente haben , und sich auch organisieren koennen und zusammenhalten .. davor muss man angst haben , besonders als politiker . na gut , wir haben natuerlich auch idioten unter uns .. das ist mir vollkommen klar . aber wir stehen im recht , und das weiss die regierung . seht euch doch mal an , wie die uns in der schweiz und deutschland verfolgen . ( mehr in deutschland , aber in der schweiz isses ja auch net wirklich leicht wie betroffene oder solche , die da wohen , genaustens wissen ) sie geben massenweise dafuer geld aus , obwohl es um die wirtschaftslage dieser beiden laender im moment nicht gut steht . was macht man in solchen situationen ? nicht wie erwartet fuer das wohle der buerger sorgen , sondern trotzdem einfach mal die politischen gegner mit allen mitteln auszuschalten versuchen . natuerlich braucht deutschland auch noch eines von diesen haesslichen , unnuetzen holocaustdenkmaelern , welches auch nicht zu billig sein darf . wir wissen doch , dass es bei solchen dingen nur eins a qualitaet sein darf . tschuldige , aber echt ... sowas kotzt mich nur noch an . das , was mir aber ehrlich gesagt am meisten auf die nerven geht , ist bei den linken , dass sie so jammern . worueber jammern sie ? na gut , nebst ueber die `` faschoschweine '' ? genau . `` wir haben keine rechte '' , `` die faschos duerfen so viel , und wir nicht '' , `` wir duerfen nichts '' , `` wir werden von den politikern verfolgt '' , etc . kurz : luegen . sie sagen das immer , provozieren uns danach , wir wehren uns , und dann verstecken sie sich hinter ihren `` gefuerchteten '' und `` verhassten '' politikern , a la `` mami , der hat mich geschlagen '' und danach `` aber er hat doch angefangen .. du kennst doch diese faschoschweine . '' bitte entschuldigt das ganze `` fascho '' gelabere , aber so reden sie ja wirklich . ( jedenfalls bei mir wars so , dass ich staendig so beschimpft worden bin ) na gut , ich hoere lieber auf , sonst rege ich mich ueber diesen idiotenverein noch wirklich auf . aber mal ehrlich : lieber antifanten als juden . jedenfalls war mir der antifant in meiner alten klasse noch lange nicht so verhasst wie die juden hier in meinen klassen . juden haben staendig die gleichen argumente , aber sie wirken . ( moegen sie noch so bescheuert sein ) aber beim antifanten kann man geruhsam immer wieder die gleichen ( gewinnenden ) argumente gegen sein geschwafel einsetzen und man kann auch sagen `` halt die klappe du idiot '' ohne dass man `` antisemit ! '' genannt wird . erinnert mich an eine geschichte .. da hat mich neulich jemand aus deutschland gefragt , ob wir in der schweiz sehr antisemitisch seien . sei mir nicht aufgefallen und habe ihn gefragt , wie er darauf komme . tja .. er haette eine juedische kollegin , die in der schweiz war , und alle waren recht abweisend zu ihr . das sei nur gewesen , weil sie juedin war . liebe juden , wir schweizer sind recht konservativ und halten uns am liebsten mit unseresgleichen auf . ihr muesst nicht meinen , dass alles negative gegen eine juedische person nur deswegen geschieht , weil der andere ein `` antisemit '' ist . manchmal ist es auch nur so , dass die betreffende person schlicht und ergreifend ein arschloch ist . ob ein arschloch nun juedisch oder christlich ist ... darauf kommt es nun wirklich nicht mehr an , oder ?\n",

      "die beste rede , die ich jemals aus dem konservativen lager gehört habe : quote : ... wie bekämpft man nun einen solchen feind ? zu allererst muss man ihn überhaupt erstmal ins fadenkreuz nehmen . wir machen entschieden einen fehler , wenn wir uns auf nebenkriegsschauplätzen wie etwa der islamkritik verzetteln . so wichtig und notwendig die ist  alles andere wäre aus meinem munde ja lächerlich : der islam ist eine sekundärinfektion . der islam könnte unserer gesellschaft normalerweise überhaupt nichts anhaben . er kann es nur deshalb , weil diese gesellschaft sich im würgegriff einer kaste von verrätern und verfassungsfeinden befindet . und das muss man thematisieren . wenn also die linken behaupten , islamkritik sei rassistisch , dann ist das natürlich dummes zeug , und die linken wissen auch ganz genau , dass das gelogen ist . die reaktion kann aber nicht die sein , zu beweisen , dass islamkritik nicht rassistisch ist , sondern , dass man den spieß umdreht : wenn ihr sagt , wir seien rassisten , weil wir für die erhaltung des eigenen volkes kämpfen , dann sagt ihr , dass ihr gegen dieses eigene volk kämpft . die sagen das in anderen zusammenhängen ja auch ganz offen . nur muss man das dann auch polemisch gegen sie wenden . überhaupt muss man deutlich machen , wofür man kämpft , damit auch klar ist , wogegen die anderen sind . wenn man allzusehr zum beispiel auf dem islam herumhackt , gibt man den linken nur gelegenheit , sich in ihre robin-hood-pose zu werfen und sich als retter der bedrängten aufzuspielen . das darf man ihnen gar nicht erst durchgehen lassen . man muss klarmachen , dass sie selber der feind sind . wir können es bei der demo hier vor der tür sehen : obwohl sie genau wissen , dass es gegen sie selbst geht , halten sie plakate gegen rassismus hoch . warum ? weil sie genau wissen , dass es sich in eigener sache verdammt schlecht plädiert . das muss man deutlich machen : diese leute kämpfen nicht für die rechte von moslems oder irgendwelchen minderheiten , sondern gegen die rechte der mehrheit und gegen die existenz des eigenen volkes . sie kämpfen nicht für die rechte von frauen , sondern gegen die institution familie . nicht für die interessen von sozial schwachen , sondern gegen das , was in ihrer sprache die deutschen spießer sind , also gegen diejenigen , die dumm genug sind , ehrliche arbeit zu leisten . die kämpfen nicht einmal gegen rassismus . erstens sind sie selber die größten rassisten  ich kann mir jedenfalls nicht vorstellen , dass es irgendetwas rassistischeres geben kann , als ein ganzes volk zu zerstören , und zweitens ist dieser sogenannte kampf gegen rassismus nichts weiter als eine chiffre dafür , dass diejenigen , die nicht links sind , ihre meinung nicht mehr sagen sollen , das heißt sie kämpfen für ihre eigene macht und für sonst gar nichts . man darf ihnen auch diese lächerliche rebellenpose nicht durchgehen lassen . es gibt doch nichts angepassteres und opportunistischeres als diese leute , die allesamt von staatsknete leben  machen aber auf revolutionär , und unangepasst und nonkonformistisch . ... warum ich kein linker mehr bin : video und text | korrektheiten\n",

      "declaration kal : wir sind verboten . na und ? in den frühen morgenstunden des heutigen 23.08.12 startete in nrw eine großangelegte razzia gegen heimattreue aktivisten , von medien und system `` rechtsextremisten '' oder `` neonazis '' genannt . dabei durchsuchten circa 800 polizeibeamte weit über 100 wohnungen und gebäude . hintergrund war das verbot der kameradschaft hamm , des nationalen widerstands dortmund sowie der kameradschaft aachener land durch nrw-innenminister jäger . in der verbotsverfügung der kameradschaft aachener land werden gut 40 personen aufgeführt , die im jäger und kumpanen als `` mitglieder '' dieser `` vereinigung '' betrachten . beim betrachten dieser liste konnten sich wohl die meisten akivisten heute morgen ein lachen nicht verkneifen . denn dort finden sich neben altgedienten kameraden genau so sehr junge und gerade erst hinzugestoßene aktivisten als auch verräter , außteiger , personen die eher dem drogenmilieu zugerechnet werden und personen , die irgendwie niemandem ein begriff sind . auffällig war bei den durchsuchungen , daß sich die durchsuchenden polizeibeamten mit vorliebe auf dinge stürzten , die zwar keinerlei strafrechtliche relevanz besitzen , sich jedoch auf dem obligatorischen `` beutetisch '' , mit dem die polizei nach solchen aktionen stets vor der öffentlichkeit zu prahlen versucht , immer sehr gut machen . so wurden auf einmal deko-waffen oder softair-pistolen einkassiert , die bei den vergangenen 100 hausdurchsuchungen , auf gut deutsch gesagt , kein schwein interessiert hatten . wieso auch ? ist der besitz doch vollkommen legal , wie auch jeder laie weiß . da findet man weitaus mehr , wenn man schüler einer hauptschule in einem sozialen brennpunkt morgens vor der schule filzt . doch der staat weiß , dass er strafrechtlich nicht viel gegen die aktivisten in der hand hat . so macht auch im jäger keinen hehl aus seinen wahren beweggründen : `` wir reißen damit große löcher in das netzwerk der neonazis '' . es ist sicherlich nicht von der hand zu weisen , daß diese aktion eine große umstrukturierung zur folge haben wird , doch ob er sich und der polizei damit einen gefallen getan hat , bleibt abzuwarten . so bemerkten im laufe des heutigen tages andere gutmenschen an mehreren stellen bereits , daß `` die handelnden personen mit dem verbot nicht von der bildfläche verschwunden sind '' . somit entlarvt sich diese aktion als vorrangig propagandistischer schachzug des spd politikers . die folgen für uns sind klar : wir werden diesem system , so lange das verbot besteht , sicherlich nicht den gefallen tun und uns kriminalisieren laßen , indem wir eine verbotene vereinigung weiter führen oder eine ersatzorganisation gründen . aber wozu auch ? das brauchen wir ja gar nicht . das ist das schöne am nationalen widerstand : es gibt unglaublich viele aktionsformen . und in manch einer aachener amtsstube hörte man es heute morgen ob solcher realitätsferne schon deutlich rumoren : hatte die polizei doch bisher ihre `` schäfchen schön beisammen '' und mußte sich lediglich um eine ernstzunehmende aktionsplattform kümmern , so sind nun alle schön verstreut , versprengt und niemand hat mehr die kontrolle über die einzelnen akteure . denn eines weiß er ja bereits : selbst wenn die gruppierung verboten wird , so bleiben doch die aktivisten . und das gibt jetzt das totale chaos . viel spaß damit ! eure kameradschaft aachener land\n",

      "berlin-kreuzberg fest in türkischer hand – die wahre seite von multi-kulti im berliner stadtteil kreuzberg ist fast jeder dritte bewohner türkischer herkunft . unzählige dönerbuden , türkische bäckereien , obstgeschäfte und andere läden prägen das ortsbild . auch drei moscheen , zahlreiche türkische kulturzentren , türkische rechtsanwälte , fahrschulen und zahnärzte sind in `` klein-istanbul '' , wie berlin-kreuzberg auch genannt wird , realität . im bericht `` heile multikulti-welt zeigt risse '' , welcher am 4 . august im `` bieler tagblatt '' erschienen ist , wurde deutlich wie selten dargelegt , welche folgen die überfremdung ( `` multi-kulti '' ) hat . so gibt die türkischstämmige quartiersbeauftragte von kreuzberg offen zu , dass die grössten probleme verwahrlosung , müll , drogen , gewalt und arbeitslosigkeit sind . dies äussert sich auch in der ausländerbeteiligung an gewaltdelikten , bestätigt die polizeidirektion . so gehen beispielsweise neun von zehn fällen im bereich drogenkriminalität und strassenkriminalität in kreuzberg auf menschen türkischer herkunft zurück . zur situation in kreuzberg meint alev kubat-celik , die koordinatorin im büro für wohnumfeld-verbesserungen am mariannenplatz , dass `` der druck und die notwendigkeit sich zu integrieren , [ … ] bei den türken praktisch nicht mehr vorhanden '' sei . diese entwicklung zeigt sich ebenfalls in der aussage eines 82-jährigen deutschen ( ! ) rentners , der seit über 30 jahren in kreuzberg wohnt : `` sicher sind nicht alle deutsche zufrieden mit der umgebung , aber alles in allem leben wir in guter nachbarschaft mit den türken . '' allein schon mit diesem satz wird deutlich , wer sich in kreuzberg wem anpassen muss , so leben etwa nicht die türken in guter nachbarschaft mit den deutschen – sondern den realen machtverhältnissen in `` klein-istanbul '' entsprechend – umgekehrt die deutschen mit den türken . wenn auch berlin-kreuzberg ein besonders schlimmes beispiel für die auswirkungen der schrankenlosen einwanderungspolitik ist , so muss daran erinnert werden , dass auch schweizer grossstädte wie basel ganz ähnliche zahlen aufweisen . in der ganzen stadt beträgt der ausländeranteil 26,9 prozent – quartiere in welchen ausländer deutlich die mehrheit der bevölkerung stellen , sind keine seltenheit . selbst schulklassen , in welchen mehr als 80 prozent der kinder ausländer sind , gehören in basel zur realität . dass die zunehmende überfremdung – trotz allen vergeblichen multi-kulti-integrationsträumen – eine soziale , wirtschaftliche und vor allem machtpolitische zeitbombe darstellt , wagt kaum jemand offen auszusprechen .\n",

      "quote : kaliningrad : zw . regermanisierung und tilsiter frieden kaliningrad . sie nimmt wieder einmal fahrt auf : die umbennungsdebatte . soll kaliningrad wieder königsberg heißen ? und sowjetsk demnächst wieder tilsit ? selbst gouverneur georgij boos diskutiert munter mit . an das bier der marke königsberg premium in kaliningrader supermarktregalen hat igor rewin sich mittlerweile wohl gewöhnt . auch den wodka der marke wostotschnaja prussija , zu deutsch `` ostpreußen '' , hat der chef der kommunistischen partei in russlands westlichster provinz sicher schon einmal probiert . möglicherweise hat er auch sogar kenigsbergskije klopsy auf dem teller gehabt im restaurant `` pritschal '' am oberteich . doch das war´s dann auch mit königsberg . wehe , ein halbwegs bekannter mensch der kaliningrader politik deutet in der öffentlichkeit eine vorsichtige annäherung an die einstigen ostpreußischen ortsnamen in der beuteprovinz an ! als felix lapin , geschäftsführender oberbürgermeister kaliningrads , im frühling dieses jahres gegenüber dem radiosender `` echo moskwy '' offen für eine rückbenennung der gebietshauptstadt in königsberg aussprach , trommelte rewin umgehend seine truppen in partei und medien zusammen . erst faltete ein vaterländisches zeitungsecho city-manager lapin so zusammen , dass der verschreckt von seiner `` privatmeinung '' sprach . kurz darauf gründete eine allianz aus kriegsveteranen , russisch-nationalen volkspatrioten und kommunisten ein `` komitee gegen die regermanisierung kaliningrads '' . igor rewin vorneweg . große historische bedeutung die öffentliche und kontroverse diskussion darüber , ob man den städten im gebiet kaliningrad , wenn ihre bewohner es denn wünschen , die historischen namen zurückgeben sollte , ist freilich längst teil der kaliningrader alltagskultur . jetzt hat sich auch gouverneur georgi boos zu wort gemeldet . nicht zum ersten mal , doch erstmal so deutlich . im gespräch mit dem radiosender `` echo moskwy '' , der zu einer art verlautbarungsorgan in der kaliningrader königsberg-debatte zu avancieren scheint , zeigte der gebietschef eine menge verständnis für die alten namen der ostpreußen-provinz . als beispiel nannte er sowjetsk , die zweitgrößte stadt des gebietes , das frühere tilsit . `` mit dem heutigen namen verbinden viele , vor allem die jüngeren einwohner der stadt keine tradition , keine positiven emotionen mehr . sowjetsk , die stadt der räte ? die sowjetunion ist längst vergangenheit . '' tilsit hingegen stehe für eine große historische bedeutung der stadt , auch in der russischen geschichte  durch den tilsiter frieden . vor diesem hintergrund , meint der gouverneur , sei zu verstehen , dass nicht wenige einwohner von sowjetsk dafür plädieren , der stadt ihren historischen namen zurückzugeben . `` und es ist nicht ausgeschlossen , dass dies früher oder später auch passieren wird . '' `` unsere geschichte , große geschichte '' insgesamt sei das thema ein schwieriges und auch schmerzhaftes , das könne angesichts seiner konsequenzen auch nicht anders sein , sagt boos . existenzrecht habe sowohl der heutige als auch der historische name eines ortes . `` städte wie gussew , gurjewsk , tschernjachowsk sind nach helden der sowjetarmee bekannt , sie führten die erstürmung dieser orte an . das ist unsere geschichte , große geschichte . aber man muss andererseits auch anerkennen , dass hinter den alten städtenamen kultur und tradition stehen . und die geschichte hatte auch ihre großen ereignisse , die den ort geprägt haben . eine entscheidung , wie die stadt nun zukünftig heißen soll , ist da naturgemäß schwierig . '' doch da ein kompromiss immer in der mitte liege , dürfe man die frage der umbenennung weder mit gewalt noch in großer eile entscheiden , meint georgij boos . und sie darf niemanden brechen . darum wäre ich auch dagegen , in dieser diskussion irgendetwas von oben anzuordnen . wenn die bewohner einer stadt es wollen , wenn sie so eine initiative gründen , dann muss es ein referendum geben , in dessen ergebnis sich zeigen wird , wie die stadt heißen soll . '' rechtlich wäre das sogar möglich , ohne gesetze zu ändern . gebietswahlleiter sergej lunjow , von amts wegen auch für die durchführung von bürgerentscheiden zuständig , sieht keine rechtlichen hindernisse für solche initiativen : '' es müssen sich mindestens zehn personen in einer solchen bewegung zusammenfinden , sie können ihr anliegen über den stadtrat oder eine partei einbringen und beantragen und dann unterstützerunterschriften sammeln . wenn mindestens fünf prozent der bevölkerung dafür sind , ist das referendum zulässig . '' soweit ist es gekommen im gebiet kaliningrad : der gebietswahlchef erörtert öffentlich das procedere von bürgerentscheiden , russischen orten die alten deutschen namen zurückzugeben . aber gibt es tatsächlich solche initiativen ? oder ist das alles nur theaterrummel von gebietsbeamten , die sich wichtig machen wollen ? sowjetsk oder tilsit ? fifty-fifty . am weitesten in dieser debatte ist sicherlich sowjetsk . hier erweisen nicht nur der örtliche radiosender ( tilsitskaja wolna ) , das städtische theater ( tilsit-teatr ) und das offizielle wappen der stadt dem alten namen die ehre ; seit drei jahren gibt es auch eine bürgerbewegung , die für die rückbenennung in tilsit wirbt . eine einheitliche meinung sieht bürgermeister viktor smilgin in der stadt allerdings nicht : `` es steht so fifty-fifty . die jugend ist sicher mehrheitlich für tilsit , bei den älteren überwiegt sowjetsk . '' es sei ganz offensichtlich , dass die bevölkerung für eine umbenennung noch nicht bereit sei , meint smilgin . `` natürlich , man könnte jetzt einen beschluss in den stadtrat einbringen und die leute vor vollendete tatsachen stellen . aber das wäre nicht richtig , und es wäre auch nicht gut . der name der stadt , das ist ausschließlich eine frage der einwohner , und man darf sie nicht überstimmen . die zeit ist einfach noch nicht reif , kann sein , wir kehren irgendwann zu dieser idee zurück . '' auch in den ostseestädten sind die alten namen längst wieder in mode  nur : umbenennen , das ist noch ein ganz anderes thema . das seebad selenogradsk etwa hat an den ortseingängen auf großen willkommens-plakaten auch das deutsche `` cranz '' darunter geschrieben . in swetlogrosk heißt ein hotel und ein restaurant nach dem alten `` rauschen '' . ein `` zurück in die zukunft '' steht hier freilich nicht zur debatte : `` der name swetlogorsk heißt übersetzt stadt des lichts , das ist eine gute bezeichnung , und so sind wir als kurbad heute auch in russland bekannt '' , sagt bürgermeister walerij tatschkow . `` natürlich , wenn die bewohner unserer stadt eine rückbenennung wollten , das wäre eine andere sache , aber so eine diskussion gibt es in swetlogorsk nicht . wir haben ja auch nicht eine so große historische bedeutung wie etwa tilsit oder friedland . '' kniefall vor den deutschen ? ob gussew-gumbinnen , tschernjachowsk-insterburg , prawdinsk-friedland oder bagrationowsk-preußisch eylau : entdecken lassen sich die einstigen namen mittlerweile vielerorts im einstigen ostpreußen . für rewin und seine genossen sind das `` kniefälle vor den deutschen '' , zeichen einer `` schleichenden '' germanisierung im gebiet kaliningrad : dieses stück fruchtbares baltikum ist uns von der sowjetmacht gegeben worden . und damit begann hier eine andere , unsere geschichte , welche man jetzt weiter schreiben muss , anstatt andauernd zurückzublicken .

'' kaliningrad : zw . regermanisierung und tilsiter frieden kaliningrad . sie nimmt wieder einmal fahrt auf : die umbennungsdebatte . soll kaliningrad wieder königsberg heißen ? und sowjetsk demnächst wieder tilsit ? selbst gouverneur georgij boos diskutiert munter mit . an das bier der marke königsberg premium in kaliningrader supermarktregalen hat igor rewin sich mittlerweile wohl gewöhnt . auch den wodka der marke wostotschnaja prussija , zu deutsch `` ostpreußen '' , hat der chef der kommunistischen partei in russlands westlichster provinz sicher schon einmal probiert . möglicherweise hat er auch sogar kenigsbergskije klopsy auf dem teller gehabt im restaurant `` pritschal '' am oberteich . doch das war´s dann auch mit königsberg . wehe , ein halbwegs bekannter mensch der kaliningrader politik deutet in der öffentlichkeit eine vorsichtige annäherung an die einstigen ostpreußischen ortsnamen in der beuteprovinz an ! als felix lapin , geschäftsführender oberbürgermeister kaliningrads , im frühling dieses jahres gegenüber dem radiosender `` echo moskwy '' offen für eine rückbenennung der gebietshauptstadt in königsberg aussprach , trommelte rewin umgehend seine truppen in partei und medien zusammen . erst faltete ein vaterländisches zeitungsecho city-manager lapin so zusammen , dass der verschreckt von seiner `` privatmeinung '' sprach . kurz darauf gründete eine allianz aus kriegsveteranen , russisch-nationalen volkspatrioten und kommunisten ein `` komitee gegen die regermanisierung kaliningrads '' . igor rewin vorneweg . große historische bedeutung die öffentliche und kontroverse diskussion darüber , ob man den städten im gebiet kaliningrad , wenn ihre bewohner es denn wünschen , die historischen namen zurückgeben sollte , ist freilich längst teil der kaliningrader alltagskultur . jetzt hat sich auch gouverneur georgi boos zu wort gemeldet . nicht zum ersten mal , doch erstmal so deutlich . im gespräch mit dem radiosender `` echo moskwy '' , der zu einer art verlautbarungsorgan in der kaliningrader königsberg-debatte zu avancieren scheint , zeigte der gebietschef eine menge verständnis für die alten namen der ostpreußen-provinz . als beispiel nannte er sowjetsk , die zweitgrößte stadt des gebietes , das frühere tilsit . `` mit dem heutigen namen verbinden viele , vor allem die jüngeren einwohner der stadt keine tradition , keine positiven emotionen mehr . sowjetsk , die stadt der räte ? die sowjetunion ist längst vergangenheit . '' tilsit hingegen stehe für eine große historische bedeutung der stadt , auch in der russischen geschichte  durch den tilsiter frieden . vor diesem hintergrund , meint der gouverneur , sei zu verstehen , dass nicht wenige einwohner von sowjetsk dafür plädieren , der stadt ihren historischen namen zurückzugeben . `` und es ist nicht ausgeschlossen , dass dies früher oder später auch passieren wird . '' `` unsere geschichte , große geschichte '' insgesamt sei das thema ein schwieriges und auch schmerzhaftes , das könne angesichts seiner konsequenzen auch nicht anders sein , sagt boos . existenzrecht habe sowohl der heutige als auch der historische name eines ortes . `` städte wie gussew , gurjewsk , tschernjachowsk sind nach helden der sowjetarmee bekannt , sie führten die erstürmung dieser orte an . das ist unsere geschichte , große geschichte . aber man muss andererseits auch anerkennen , dass hinter den alten städtenamen kultur und tradition stehen . und die geschichte hatte auch ihre großen ereignisse , die den ort geprägt haben . eine entscheidung , wie die stadt nun zukünftig heißen soll , ist da naturgemäß schwierig . '' doch da ein kompromiss immer in der mitte liege , dürfe man die frage der umbenennung weder mit gewalt noch in großer eile entscheiden , meint georgij boos . und sie darf niemanden brechen . darum wäre ich auch dagegen , in dieser diskussion irgendetwas von oben anzuordnen . wenn die bewohner einer stadt es wollen , wenn sie so eine initiative gründen , dann muss es ein referendum geben , in dessen ergebnis sich zeigen wird , wie die stadt heißen soll . '' rechtlich wäre das sogar möglich , ohne gesetze zu ändern . gebietswahlleiter sergej lunjow , von amts wegen auch für die durchführung von bürgerentscheiden zuständig , sieht keine rechtlichen hindernisse für solche initiativen : '' es müssen sich mindestens zehn personen in einer solchen bewegung zusammenfinden , sie können ihr anliegen über den stadtrat oder eine partei einbringen und beantragen und dann unterstützerunterschriften sammeln . wenn mindestens fünf prozent der bevölkerung dafür sind , ist das referendum zulässig . '' soweit ist es gekommen im gebiet kaliningrad : der gebietswahlchef erörtert öffentlich das procedere von bürgerentscheiden , russischen orten die alten deutschen namen zurückzugeben . aber gibt es tatsächlich solche initiativen ? oder ist das alles nur theaterrummel von gebietsbeamten , die sich wichtig machen wollen ? sowjetsk oder tilsit ? fifty-fifty . am weitesten in dieser debatte ist sicherlich sowjetsk . hier erweisen nicht nur der örtliche radiosender ( tilsitskaja wolna ) , das städtische theater ( tilsit-teatr ) und das offizielle wappen der stadt dem alten namen die ehre ; seit drei jahren gibt es auch eine bürgerbewegung , die für die rückbenennung in tilsit wirbt . eine einheitliche meinung sieht bürgermeister viktor smilgin in der stadt allerdings nicht : `` es steht so fifty-fifty . die jugend ist sicher mehrheitlich für tilsit , bei den älteren überwiegt sowjetsk . '' es sei ganz offensichtlich , dass die bevölkerung für eine umbenennung noch nicht bereit sei , meint smilgin . `` natürlich , man könnte jetzt einen beschluss in den stadtrat einbringen und die leute vor vollendete tatsachen stellen . aber das wäre nicht richtig , und es wäre auch nicht gut . der name der stadt , das ist ausschließlich eine frage der einwohner , und man darf sie nicht überstimmen . die zeit ist einfach noch nicht reif , kann sein , wir kehren irgendwann zu dieser idee zurück . '' auch in den ostseestädten sind die alten namen längst wieder in mode  nur : umbenennen , das ist noch ein ganz anderes thema . das seebad selenogradsk etwa hat an den ortseingängen auf großen willkommens-plakaten auch das deutsche `` cranz '' darunter geschrieben . in swetlogrosk heißt ein hotel und ein restaurant nach dem alten `` rauschen '' . ein `` zurück in die zukunft '' steht hier freilich nicht zur debatte : `` der name swetlogorsk heißt übersetzt stadt des lichts , das ist eine gute bezeichnung , und so sind wir als kurbad heute auch in russland bekannt '' , sagt bürgermeister walerij tatschkow . `` natürlich , wenn die bewohner unserer stadt eine rückbenennung wollten , das wäre eine andere sache , aber so eine diskussion gibt es in swetlogorsk nicht . wir haben ja auch nicht eine so große historische bedeutung wie etwa tilsit oder friedland . '' kniefall vor den deutschen ? ob gussew-gumbinnen , tschernjachowsk-insterburg , prawdinsk-friedland oder bagrationowsk-preußisch eylau : entdecken lassen sich die einstigen namen mittlerweile vielerorts im einstigen ostpreußen . für rewin und seine genossen sind das `` kniefälle vor den deutschen '' , zeichen einer `` schleichenden '' germanisierung im gebiet kaliningrad : dieses stück fruchtbares baltikum ist uns von der sowjetmacht gegeben worden . und damit begann hier eine andere , unsere geschichte , welche man jetzt weiter schreiben muss , anstatt andauernd zurückzublicken . '' es gehe auch ihm nicht darum , die kulturhistorischen spuren der deutschen zu vergessen , beteuert der kommunistenchef . aber : `` wen sollen denn all diese umbenennungen beglücken , wenn nicht die deutschen ? will man auf diese weise wirklich investoren anlocken ? das wird nicht passieren . nein , wir müssen unsere geschichte leben , unsere feste feiern , unsere wirtschaft entwickeln . wir müssen nach vorn schauen und nicht in der vergangenheit leben .

      "dem israelischen staatspräsidenten mosche katzav verdankt die welt neuerdings die erkenntnis , dass nebst neonazis und weiteren gruppierungen auch die gegnerinnen der globalisierung am unseligen antisemitismus beteiligt sind . anlässlich eines dreitägigen besuchs wurde mosche katzav in berlin durch bundespräsident johannes rau als staatsgast empfangen , welcher ihm am mittwoch anlässlich der dort gleichzeitig abgehaltenen antisemitismus-konferenz ein abendessen gab , und an mehr als 500 teilnehmende aus total 55 osze-ländern auch . aussenminister joschka fischer leitete die deutsche experten-delegation persönlich . was viele schon lange glaubten , aber kaum laut zu denken wagten , ist nun von höchster warte bestätigt und festgestellt : der weltweite kampf gegen die mörderische globalisierung trägt gradlinig zum weit verbreiteten antisemitismus und damit zu einem affront gegen israel bei . dieses erstaunliche fazit äusserte der israelische staatspräsident in einem tv-gespräch , ohne dafür argumente anzuführen . damit erreicht der disput um die verflixte thematik eine neue dimension , die exorbitante anzahl der globalisierungsgegnerinnen sieht sich dadurch wenig plausiblen beschuldigungen ausgesetzt . würde dieses etikett auch auf die betroffenen und verlierer der weltweit zusammengezogenen produktionsprozesse passen , stiege die anzahl an leibhaftigen antisemitinnen über nacht nahezu auf das total der hälftigen weltbevölkerung an . katzav würde dadurch auch das vorgehen von polizei und militärs in genua ( und z.b . in landquart ) nachträglich legitimieren , da ihnen bloss antisemitischer pöbel vor der sonne stand . zwar könnten sich inhalt und deutung der katzavschen aussagen noch geringfügig relativieren ( das gespräch wurde in englisch geführt ) . bei der brisanz der tollkühnen behauptung wäre es kaum zufällig , sollten doch noch etwaige `` verständigungsfehler '' den satten fauxpas entschärfen . beobachter glauben jedenfalls nicht , dass in der gemeinsamen schlussresolution der osze-konferierenden die weisheiten des staatspräsidenten offiziell eingang finden werden . in berlin glaubt man eher an einen verschlucker oder verstolperer als an eine bösartige entgleisung des hochrangigen gastes . die bilateralen beziehungen halten sich nach wie vor auf hohem niveau . verlautbarungen , wonach fischer seine mehrheitlich mit vorbehalten zur globalisierung behafteten landsleute verteidigt haben soll , bleiben noch unbestätigt . der verteidigungsminister hiesse schliesslich struck .\n",

( lacht hämisch ) hey , wer kam eigentlich auf den namen `` titanic '' ? waren sie das , bruce ? ja , ganz recht . ich wollte damit die reine größe zum ausdruck bringen . größe bedeutet stabilität , luxus und vor allem stärke . haben sie schon von dr. freud gehört , mr. ismay ? was er über die männliche besessenheit was `` größe '' anbelangt , bemerkt hat , dürfte sie interessieren . - was ist nur in dich gefahren ? - entschuldigen sie mich. ich muß mich entschuldigen . sie ist eine waffe , cal ! ich hoffe , sie können mit ihr umgehen ? ich sollte von jetzt an wohl besser die abendlektüre meiner verlobten überprüfen . freud ? wer ist das ? ein passagier ? - das schiff ist ganz gut , hä ? - ja , ist auch ein irisches schiff . es ist doch englisch , oder ? nein , es wurde in irland gebaut . 15.000 iren haben es gebaut . stark wie ein fels . geschaffen von kräftigen irischen händen . ist ja mal wieder typisch ! die köter aus der ersten klasse kommen hier runter um sich auszuscheissen ! damit wird uns gezeigt , wo wir uns im gesamtbild befinden . als würden wir das vergessen . - ich bin tommy ryan . - jack dawson . - hallo - fabrizio . - hi . hast du mit deinen bildern schon was verdient ? ah , vergiß es , mein freund . an eine frau wie die kommst du nicht ran . vorher fliegen dir kleine engel aus dem hintern . rose , was war das eben für ein auftritt ? du hast versprochen , dich zu benehmen . ich sah mein leben vor mir , als ob ich es bereits hinter mir hätte . eine endlose aneinanderreihung von partys ...   \n",
