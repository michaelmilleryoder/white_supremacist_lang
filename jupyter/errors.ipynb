       "      <td>your environmenttor contains weaknesses which can only be mitigated through actions in the physical world . an attacker who can view both your local internet connection , and the connection of the site you are visiting , can use statistical analysis to correlate them . 1 . never use tor from home , or near home . never work on anything sensitive enough to require tor from home , even if you remain offline . computers have a funny habit of liking to be connected . this also applies to anywhere you are staying temporarily , such as a hotel . never performing these activities at home helps to ensure that they can not be tied to those locations . ( note that this applies to people facing advanced persistent threats . running tor from home is reasonable and useful for others , especially people who are n't doing anything themselves but wish to help by running an exit node , relay , or bridge . 2 . limit the amount of time you spend using tor at any single location . while these correlation attacks do take some time , they can in theory be completed in as little as a day . and while the jackboots are very unlikely to show up the same day you fire up tor at starbucks , they might show up the next day . i recommend for the truly concerned to never use tor more than 24 hours at any single physical location ; after that , consider it burned and go elsewhere . this will help you even if the jackboots show up six months later ; it 's much easier to remember a regular customer than someone who showed up one day and never came back . this does mean you will have to travel farther afield , especially if you do n't live in a large city , but it will help to preserve your ability to travel freely . 3 . when you go out to perform these activities , leave your cell phone turned on and at home.your mindsetmany tor users get caught because they made a mistake , such as posting their real e-mail address in association with their activities . you must avoid this as much as possible , and the only way to do so is with careful mental discipline . 1 . think of your tor activity as pseudonymous , and create in your mind a virtual identity to correspond with the activity . this virtual person does not know you and will never meet you , and would n't even like you if he knew you . he must be kept strictly mentally separated . 2 . if you must use public internet services , create completely new accounts for this pseudonym . never mix them ; for instance do not browse facebook with your real e-mail address after having used twitter with your pseudonym 's e-mail on the same computer . wait until you get home . 3 . by the same token , never perform actions related to your pseudonymous activity via the clearnet , unless you have no other choice ( e.g . to sign up for a provider who blocks tor ) , and take extra precautions regarding your location when doing so . 4 . if you need to make and receive phone calls , purchase an anonymous prepaid phone for the purpose . this is difficult in some countries , but it can be done if you are creative enough . pay cash ; never use a debit or credit card to buy the phone or top-ups . never insert its battery or turn it on if you are within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of your home , nor use a phone from which the battery can not be removed . never place a sim card previously used in one phone into another phone . never give its number or even admit its existence to anyone who knows you by your real identity . this may need to include your family members .</td>\n",

       "3894       your environmenttor contains weaknesses which can only be mitigated through actions in the physical world . an attacker who can view both your local internet connection , and the connection of the site you are visiting , can use statistical analysis to correlate them . 1 . never use tor from home , or near home . never work on anything sensitive enough to require tor from home , even if you remain offline . computers have a funny habit of liking to be connected . this also applies to anywhere you are staying temporarily , such as a hotel . never performing these activities at home helps to ensure that they can not be tied to those locations . ( note that this applies to people facing advanced persistent threats . running tor from home is reasonable and useful for others , especially people who are n't doing anything themselves but wish to help by running an exit node , relay , or bridge . 2 . limit the amount of time you spend using tor at any single location . while these correlation attacks do take some time , they can in theory be completed in as little as a day . and while the jackboots are very unlikely to show up the same day you fire up tor at starbucks , they might show up the next day . i recommend for the truly concerned to never use tor more than 24 hours at any single physical location ; after that , consider it burned and go elsewhere . this will help you even if the jackboots show up six months later ; it 's much easier to remember a regular customer than someone who showed up one day and never came back . this does mean you will have to travel farther afield , especially if you do n't live in a large city , but it will help to preserve your ability to travel freely . 3 . when you go out to perform these activities , leave your cell phone turned on and at home.your mindsetmany tor users get caught because they made a mistake , such as posting their real e-mail address in association with their activities . you must avoid this as much as possible , and the only way to do so is with careful mental discipline . 1 . think of your tor activity as pseudonymous , and create in your mind a virtual identity to correspond with the activity . this virtual person does not know you and will never meet you , and would n't even like you if he knew you . he must be kept strictly mentally separated . 2 . if you must use public internet services , create completely new accounts for this pseudonym . never mix them ; for instance do not browse facebook with your real e-mail address after having used twitter with your pseudonym 's e-mail on the same computer . wait until you get home . 3 . by the same token , never perform actions related to your pseudonymous activity via the clearnet , unless you have no other choice ( e.g . to sign up for a provider who blocks tor ) , and take extra precautions regarding your location when doing so . 4 . if you need to make and receive phone calls , purchase an anonymous prepaid phone for the purpose . this is difficult in some countries , but it can be done if you are creative enough . pay cash ; never use a debit or credit card to buy the phone or top-ups . never insert its battery or turn it on if you are within 10 miles ( 16 km ) of your home , nor use a phone from which the battery can not be removed . never place a sim card previously used in one phone into another phone . never give its number or even admit its existence to anyone who knows you by your real identity . this may need to include your family members .   \n",
